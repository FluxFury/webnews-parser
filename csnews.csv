Lemondogs was more about getting some old friends together who are good at Counter-Strike.\"""", ""When asked why he quit, znajder explained that the uncertainty, lack of long-term opportunities, and the industry's economic state pushed him to pursue a regular job. For example, he stated that he is owed approximately 30,000 EUR to this day for his services as a professional, an experience shared by many other players from that time."", ""Following the gradual erosion of GODSENT after the ill-fated swap with fnatic that had the two organizations trade flusha and JW for Simon \""twist\"" Eliasson and Joakim \""disco doplan\"" Gidetun, znajder had brief stints with an international EURONICS side and a Swedish team, Ancient, but neither project had the same gravitas or momentum as GODSENT."", ""Ultimately, znajder made his last appearance in CS:GO under Lemondogs, which, as he mentioned, was simply a fun project \u2014 a last dance with close friends."", ""In the summer of 2019, znajder was approached by one of his friends with an opportunity to teach an esports course at a Swedish school. Having already hoped for such an opportunity, he didn\u2019t hesitate to take it and is now completing his sixth year as a teacher."", ""Over time, his role has expanded beyond teaching about esports, and he is now involved in subjects such as English, Physical Education, and Web Development. Today, he has sixty students under his tutelage, of which five made it to school esports tournaments and leagues."", ""Extensive experience in team dynamics and how to work together with a group towards a goal, znajder emphasized that the soft skills he has picked up during his tenure as a professional player have served him well in his life after esports. \""Working as a five, plus a coach, towards really high goals\u2026 that puts a lot of pressure and demand on you as a person and player,\"" he explains."", ""Still, znajder has ambitions beyond his educational duties. \""I do enjoy coaching. I think I\u2019m pretty good at it, and I\u2019ve had some success in the Swedish leagues, but I would rather do that as a side project,\"" he confessed. Instead, znajder\u2019s long-term career plans lie in IT, a field that he has meant to get involved in for several years."", ""When he was younger, znajder decided against a university education to pursue his career as a professional CS player, something that he plans to make up for now as he is going to start applying to higher education. \""Hopefully, if we catch each other again in five years, I\u2019ll be working in IT,\"" he quips."", ""After discussing his future plans, the conversation shifted to his past. Although znajder holds the rare accolade of winning the first CS:GO Major, his fondest memory was participating in another. \""For me, it was actually the 2017 ELEAGUE Major,\"" he says. \""After fnatic, I had a lot of struggles, and it was hard for me to find a footing in tier 1 and tier 2. When we reached it with GODSENT, just reaching a Major again after a three-year break from Majors, it was amazing to me even though we ended up 2-3 in the Swiss stage.\"""", ""GODSENT's participation at the Major in Atlanta was partly due to znajder, a key performer in the team's EU Minor run.

You can try to shove stuff away and be like, 'That\u2019s unlucky, let\u2019s keep going,' but it keeps happening again and again, it gets harder,\"" he reflects. As more and more pressure piled up, znajder attempted to take his own life in 2017, which his girlfriend fortunately prevented."", ""Only a few months later, znajder was involved in a horrific car crash. He swerved off a bridge and plunged into the water beneath. He was lucky enough that the rocks under the water's surface broke one of the car's windows, which allowed him to escape relatively unharmed. He played an important qualifier while still in shock only two days later. These two events and his environment\u2019s indifference towards them catalyzed his eventual departure from the industry."", ""Later in his career, znajder found out that he has suffered most of his life from a genetically inherited thyroid disease, which he has to take medication for to this day. The side effects of this disease plagued his professional career for four years, between 2014 and 2018."", ""\""I was always a bit tired, and I felt a bit rough in the morning,\"" he says. \""My routine of waking up was much longer than now. Now I just wake up, and I want to make coffee instantly and get going, but back then, when I didn\u2019t have the medicine, it was way harder.\"""", ""Despite these setbacks, znajder believes he could have applied himself more professionally. \""My biggest regret is definitely not taking my career more seriously,\"" he admits. \""I just wish I was as mature as I am today when I was a top player. My work ethic was very up and down, sadly, and if I could fix something, it would be that I actually understood what a big chance it is to be an esports professional and not take it for granted."", ""\""I think a lot of people will relate to my words there. After a while, it just ends up being like a regular job for you, and if I were more mature back then, I wouldn\u2019t have let it be just a job.\"""", ""Reflecting on this point, znajder left some advice for young players going through a similar phase. The fear of not experiencing the exciting social life of a young adult played a part in why he lacked in his commitment. \""If you are a high-level player with a contract, I still think you should go all in on that. If there are true friends on the side who you meet maybe several times a year only, they will also be there after your career."", ""\""I wish I did that a lot more. I had a lot of FOMO, I was so worried I would lose my friends, but in hindsight, I could have taken many more moments to focus on Counter-Strike than hanging out with friends.\"""", ""Such experiences inevitably shape a person, so the conversation moved to the type of life philosophy he developed in the following years. From where he stands, life is a continuous rollercoaster of uptrends and downward spirals, often leading to anxiety about the future and what lies ahead. In these moments, he advises taking a step back and then gradually working on improving. \""As long as you do what you can to make things better, they will become better, even if it's one month away or even two years away,\"" he says. \""That's my way of living.\u201d"", ""He then highlighted two more important points.

No one is perfect, but as long as you try, it will be better than it is now.\"""", ""Finally, he addressed everyone he played with throughout his career, expressing his gratitude towards them, regardless of how they left things. \""We all helped each other evolve into the people we are today,\"" he contemplates.

A goal was probably to also get him in front of this crowd, right, so what was that like and how has it been working with him?"", ""This tournament was very, very important for skullz. During the group stage he played amazing, he was in control of all of his emotions and had flowing communication, playing super well."", ""Playing on stage here was probably a new emotion and new reality for him in terms of how he has to behave next time. It's a big learning experience for him here. I'm very happy having him on the team, he brings a lot of calmness, a lot of precision to our game, and he's a great asset for the team."", ""Leaving this tournament, as you said it was a good result for you that you made the playoffs and that you got this far. What's feeling like going out of this and turning the focus to the RMRs and following events for the rest of the year?"", ""Our focus will remain the same. Analyze what can be better, step by step. Looking ahead for the RMR, it's going to be tough competition, we gotta make sure we are at the Major, there's a lot of pressure as well. That's the life of the athlete, right? You go from one to the other, the next two weeks there's something new again and you keep going through all those things."", ""For us it's coming back, we're going to have a very small break now, a few days for people to take off and do something different, and then we'll go strong to the RMR. The end of the season is going to mainly be focused on China, so it's going to be big weeks coming ahead of us.""]}",1728772380000,/news/40046/fallen-i-proposed-a-game-too-fast-for-my-own-taste

You were one win away from making the RMR. How tough was it?"", ""Yeah, it's always very important to qualify for the Major. I think that's a milestone every team tries to achieve. And I think that one was important to us. But at the same time, I think the team wasn't ready. We had a very tough loss in the first BO1.

You cannot make mistakes."", ""And it's CS2, you know\u2026 Two pistols or one gun round and you're close to being eliminated. BO1s are very crazy. And after we lost that one, we got RED Canids, a very good contender for the spot as well. It was an even match. I do think they had the upper hand as a team.

When we got him in, it was a little, not risky, but you can't be sure\u2026 Like, in Brazil, star players are different than in Europe. You have like a donk, who dominated tier-two just three years ago, or kyosuke now, or m0NESY when he was starting up. You just know they are insane, you know? In Brazil, there are a lot of people killing a lot and you cannot know they are insane because it's just a different science."", ""I was very surprised by him when he joined the team.

I do think it's a good experience for the player. It's good for him and he could not say no. But those are very tough shoes to fill."", ""It happens to so many players from all over the world, in Europe as well. Let me think\u2026 Maybe npl when he joined NAVI. He had a short spell there and he did not play that well. And now he's playing very well, you can see his stats."", ""It's a matter of places.

Now you\u2019re at a point when you\u2019re building yourself back up. How does it feel so far?"", ""It's been a different way of seeing the game. When I played for FURIA, I had outside pressure to just win, win, win. Win at any cost. It's just a different mindset and you have a different position, of course. I've been playing from Brazil, while I was with FURIA, I just played from Europe the entire year. It's a different mindset inside and outside the game. With Fluxo, I do think I have way more responsibility and tasks because we have so many young players. I stress a lot and there are a lot of things to learn."", ""It has been a learning experience. Fluxo is more of a long-term project, while with FURIA it was more about winning the next tournament. We have more time to prepare for the long run. That has also changed the mindset of the team and my own. The whole experience in general has been very different. Both sides are good."", ""When I played for FURIA, I played in big stages, and the adrenaline of playing big tournaments and facing the entire opposition, it's always a great feeling. On Fluxo, I have a different mindset. It's more of a learning/teaching role where I can have time to teach and also learn in the process. It's just different things."", ""For a while, it felt like in FURIA there were too many cooks in the kitchen, in a way. Now in Fluxo, you're the most experienced member and the one leader. Would you say you have more authority now?"", ""I don't think it was that simple. Even in FURIA, that was not really the case. When I was IGLing, I had the freedom to pretty much do a lot of things. Of course, in practice, it's a little different. And of course, you have different mindsets and that shows in the game. Overall, neither FalleN nor I was trying to go over one another. I think we did a pretty good job playing off each other's strengths during the time we played together, and the players were trying their best to make it work."", ""I think the biggest difference between FURIA and Fluxo is that in FURIA I was trying to do many things. In Fluxo, I am more focused on little things. I am not really certain, because we've been changing players, which positions I'm taking in Fluxo, if I'm going to be like a star player or more like an anchor player. I want to play star positions to help my team make plays and move across the map."", ""I want to teach them to play that way as well because we have so many young players that I have the luxury to spend some time teaching them how to play star positions. And just help develop this sense in them because playing star positions has a lot to do with making fast decisions, and I'm still kind of unsure what to do on some maps. We are trying things out, changing positions a lot. So I think that's the main difference."", ""In terms of the team composition, is it still a work in progress? Do you think you might change players in the future, or are you hopeful that this roster will last?"", ""I'm feeling comfortable with the team. I do think everyone brings great things to the team. But of course, I really want to test the players out and make them better players. Now, we're going to play a European event against European players. While we're in Brazil, it's always the same teams, same teams, same teams. Playing here is very important for us to get better at the game and also develop new things."", ""We need to play LAN stages, we need to play tournaments outside of Brazil, and this experience will help us see what we need in the team, what we need to change. I don't think about changing the roster anytime soon. It's more about finding our place on the team. And I think this experience is going to show us the path we are taking and what we can improve with time."", ""You, kye, and your coach, tacitus, have been on FURIA. Do you personally have that goal of reaching FURIA's level and being comparable to them? Do you think you can do the same or even better?"", ""Yeah, I do think so. All CS players have ambitions. I think that's mandatory. We need to be ambitious; otherwise, you cannot succeed. So of course, I have the ambition to be the best team in Brazil. As a player, that's the only thing I think about. Of course, we have a long way to get there."", ""I do think next year can be very good for us because of the way tournaments are going to be like, with fewer invites. It will be more based on Valve's ranking. It's going to change, there won't be partner teams anymore. It's going to be a lot better for us to climb the ladder and have opportunities to play bigger tournaments. It's up to us to qualify for those events. Let's see what the future brings."", ""And in terms of your personal history with FURIA. Is there a grudge factor there?"", ""Not, not at all. I do think FURIA are the best team in Brazil right now. Of course, if we're going to face them, there will be rivalry, I will want to beat them, but that's just on the server. I have known the players for many years. I root for them. I want them to be the number-one team in Brazil for a long time. But if I'm in a position where I need to play against them or I am a contender to be the best in Brazil, of course I'll take it. (laughs)"", ""After missing out on the Major, how important is this event for your team?"", ""It's like I said earlier. I'm not qualified for the Major, and also we missed out on qualifying for two other international tournaments. We lost the finals of both qualifiers. So this one is very important to us because it's the only one that is guaranteed for this semester. We have a couple more opportunities this year but it's uncertain, so we need to do our max here."", ""That's why we're bootcamping, we're trying to do the best we can to be prepared for this one. The most important thing about it is the experience. We want to learn from this experience. It doesn't matter if we win the tournament or not. The experience is going to matter a lot."", ""Solid are another Brazilian team at the event. What do you think about them? Do you think they can surprise people?"", ""Yeah. As the name suggests, they are very solid. I don't think they are a bad team in any sense. But they have struggled for consistency like we have. In this tournament, they can be either very good and qualify for playoffs or not. Same thing for us, you know? Consistency is something that requires time and experience. And they haven't got either.

Do you understand what worked and what didn\u2019t?"", ""I don't think I made many reflections back then. That's in the past for me, but I'm just trying to focus on how I can help the team. On some maps, there might be more required of me right now in fnatic, and on some maps, there's nothing. There's not much required of me because that might be a map they were very comfortable on before I even joined."", ""It's just pretty map-dependent, but I try to help with what I can. And if anyone ever asks me to chip in with more, I'm always going to be happy to do that. But other than that, I'm just going to try to focus on doing the role and stuff I have in the game."", ""The other aspect that has changed is that you joined an international team again. You\u2019ve been on and off in Danish- and English-speaking teams throughout your career, so I\u2019m wondering about your perspective. To you personally, how much of a difference is there?"", ""The biggest difference for me is that when I was in Astralis, it was so easy to meet each other all the time. We were bootcamping all the time when we practiced and met up for a lot of media days and stuff like that. In international teams, it's a little bit different. You don't meet each other as much and there's definitely going to be periods of time without you seeing them in person."", ""So I would say it's a little bit harder to get to know people really well as fast as it was in Astralis. In a Danish team like that, you get really close to people very fast, and that's the biggest difference.  Also communication maybe a little bit in the beginning. People don't have perfect English in the team, so maybe the communication is a little bit harder, but it's not a massive problem."", ""Do bootcamps help you to amend that? Does your team do things like Liquid when they were doing all those bonding experiences? Is there anything that you do in that regard to amend what you've mentioned?"", ""For sure. I'm pretty sure all teams do that. It's just not all teams who put it out on video, but all teams definitely do some sort of team activity that is supposed to be fun and help open up people. I've done that in all the teams I've been in, so that's not new to me for sure."", ""Four years in a row, you\u2019ve been in HLTV Top 20 despite also being an IGL throughout. So for many, it was surprising to see you join fnatic since the team wasn\u2019t high in the rankings. Why did you join them in the end?"", ""I understand that I'm not even considered in the top 20 now because we're not playing the biggest tournaments, so obviously that's not realistic right now. But for me, it's about choosing a place where I can prove that I'm good enough again. I'm okay with taking a step back and proving that I can play at a high level. It's up to me to show that if I want to play tier-one, I'm going to help take fnatic back to tier-one."", ""And if I'm not good enough, that's just how it is, you know,  I'm not really afraid of that challenge. I'm just going to play Counter-Strike, try to enjoy it again, and do my best to prove to people that I still have the ability to play at a high level."", ""How is the team doing relative to your expectations when you joined it? Is it in the place you would expect it to be by this point?"", ""Not at this exact moment because we just had some very bad officials. But I would say if I go like a couple of weeks back, then I would be very happy with where we're at. I think we beat a lot of the strongest tier-two teams, we were very comfortable playing them. We didn't have that much trouble, but then we changed the team and we haven't won many maps recently."", ""So I would say that right now we're not in a good spot, but it can change really quickly. Hopefully, this is a tournament where we go back to winning a lot, but I would say I'm happy with our overall performance in fnatic. It's hard to say that as well because we just lost so many games in a row, but other than that, I'm happy."", ""Recently you got nawwk on your team. He\u2019s not a top 20 player, but he built himself a decent name nevertheless. Does it feel reassuring that the team is getting such upgrades?"", ""Yeah, for sure. I like playing with nawwk. He's a very chill guy and he's shooting hard as well, and he's easy to play with because he says what's on his mind. But even though I like playing with nawwk, I just want to say I also enjoyed playing very much with afro. I don't think afro is a bad player, he's very good and he did a lot for the team. So I just want to make sure that I state that I think afro was a really great teammate in fnatic. Maybe he wasn't the right fit in that specific lineup, but I really enjoyed playing with him, he was definitely one of my favorite teammates."", ""You\u2019re now at RES Regional Champions. It features a hefty prize pool and a very competitive field, and you certainly are not underdogs here. How important is this event for your team in this context?"", ""It's pretty easy for me to say that I'm expecting us to go pretty far. I'm not saying that it has to happen, because obviously if we play like we've done in the past couple of officials, then we won't go very far. But my expectation for this event is to at least go to the playoffs. It might not happen if we play like we used to, but as I said,  we actually had some practice with nawwk now. So this is meant for us as a fresh start now. We're ready to go again, and I'm expecting something decent."", ""You referenced your recent misfortunes a couple of times. Can you share what you think went wrong? And what do you think you need to fix to step up?"", ""It's hard because it definitely went over a couple of events. We had a really good start at EPL by beating Astralis, which was the high of the team, and then we had a match against MOUZ and stuff where we just got annihilated. And then we came home and I think we changed players, and then one day after, we had officials. So we had like one prac on each map or something like that before we debuted with nawwk, but we didn't have any strats or anything really to talk about."", ""So I don't care too much about those results with him recently, but I care more about showing that we are actually ready to play now. It was a mixture of us having high highs and low lows in the past officials, but also us not having much practice with nawwk. But no excuses for us at this event, we just have to show that we can play good Counter-Strike now."", ""The last thing I wanted to ask you about is KRIMZ. He is one of the few players who\u2019s been competing at the top level from the very start of CS:GO to this day. Since 2016, he\u2019s been playing for fnatic but eventually faded away from the community\u2019s spotlight. What\u2019s your experience of playing with him, and what role does KRIMZ play in your team?"", ""He's really great to play with because he's that solid anchor in the team who can do everything. He doesn't require anything from anyone in the game to play well, he plays well all the time and he doesn't ask for hundreds of flashes or strats around him. He's really good at giving info and at taking space on the map when he sees it's needed. So I think he's just one of those great teammates that doesn't require a lot of help, but still provides a lot of value to a team."", ""It's very valuable having some of those in the team as well because I think a lot of teams have people in the team that require a lot of things, but he's one of those guys that makes a team function because he's the opposite. He's shooting hard as well, but he gave up a lot of his positions throughout the past years, I would probably say, in order to make other people play well, and he was fine with taking a step back. A great teammate, a great guy, and I'm really happy to play with him.""]}",1728997380000,/news/40065/blamef-its-up-to-me-to-help-take-fnatic-back-to-tier-one-if-i-want-to-play-there

The previous average for rating over an event had strayed from its target of 1.00 to 1.06 as players increased saving rates (and subsequently there were fewer kills, less damage, and more survivals)."", ""So even the save-shy riflers have seen a bit of a drop, now rating 2.1 has put the average back at 1.00 over an event."", ""As you can see, most now sit 2 or 3 decimal points behind their rating 2.0 value."", ""The data we will use for this piece, it's important to stress, is over a far larger sample size (every notable event in 2024) than one event so the averages will not be perfect. The same is true of a player's map-to-map rating; do not expect that to average at 1.00. Got it? Right, let's get into it."", ""AWPers have an expensive weapon, and saving is a key part of their role. Unless you are Mathieu \""ZywOo\"" Herbaut and Ilya \""m0NESY\"" Osipov, it is usually worth saving your $4,750 boom-stick for the next round rather than going for a 1v3 retake."", ""That is even more crucial in MR12, where CT economy is even more difficult than in CS:GO. You can easily engage in force-buy wars and only afford an AWP once \u2014 it's logical that AWPers save often."", ""But that was having an unfair impact on rating 2.0.  The reward for saving, in theory, should be that you have an AWP or strong weapon for the next round, and thus a higher probability of delivering kills or damage than if you had not saved."", ""So in 2.1, the formula was adjusted to weight survivals as more important in round wins. Surviving round losses also does not contribute to KAST in rating (though on-site KAST still includes saves for it's percentage)."", ""So it makes sense that AWPers are suffering more from 2.1 than 2.0. The role lends itself to high survivals (which helps KAST too) and they save more than riflers \u2014 an average of 11.3% compared to 8.0%."", ""On CT side this is especially relevant, where you still earn round loss money even when you survive. AWPers go down -0.04, with riflers all rounding to -0.03."", ""But there is a difference between active rotators, who are more likely to die early-round or go for retakes, and anchors \u2014 who are more likely to save, and get plenty of their rating from surviving in rounds where they don't see much action."", ""On T side, this is the same \u2014 0.04 for AWPers, 0.03 for riflers.

The A group was probably much easier to advance because it's more even, while here you have HEROIC, who will advance 100%, and probably 9z is the other favorite to go through Editor's note: this was recorded before they lost to ENCE in the opening round, but we're happy because it's a chance to steal a lot of points from a team like that, they're top 10 or something."", ""We expected it to be either Nuke or Anubis. We thought it would be Nuke more than Anubis, we thought they would let us play it, but they didn't. We were okay with that, we had a pretty good game plan against them and yeah, I think it was good but we probably made some miscalls. The A rush was a bit ballsy, but considering the fact that the two guys who saved the previous rounds were B players, you could count on the economy for them to play a lower buy, or that degster was stuck in A lot so we expected sjuush to play by himself. If we just won that round, the game was over. We didn't, and the game was lost. It was over anyway, but a different scenario."", ""You and SZPERO are two of the more known Polish guys outside of the G5/VP bubble; veterans of the scene, now with some younger guys. Tell me a bit about the team and how it comes together, and maybe also about Poland in general in the Counter-Strike world these days."", ""As you said, it's the good old guys and some young guys on one team. Everyone in Poland is trying to have this unless they're super young and play well all of a sudden, learning by themselves, but that's usually not the case. So yeah, it's like that."", ""We have some issues. When we're practicing, and we watch the decisions we commit, sometimes it's painful. It's not everyone, but sometimes it happens, and you get rid of those decisions with experience. We try our best to avoid them and to not make critical mistakes more than they should happen. They do happen. I also commit critical mistakes. I did today, it's normal, but sometimes we have them, and they're painful."", ""Somehow, on LAN, and it's really cool because we have young guys, we play better. I don't know if it's our focus or will to win, and we understand that this is our chance to go up in the rankings and win something, but here we play much better than on the internet. It doesn't matter if it's open qualifiers or something, we don't play well. I don't know if it could also be a difference in how people play online and on LAN."", ""For example, we had our worst practice month ever now, the results were bad \u2014 that's a good word, I would say \u2014, they were sometimes terrible. We just focused on our strats and improvements in the game, it was really tough to play it online. In practice, officials, whatever. It was almost impossible, nothing worked.

Just against a different opponent, I guess, maybe that's it."", ""You and SZPERO have played at this level, and maybe not at a consistent tier-one level, but definitely LANs of this size and bigger on occasion. How is it now, going through what you're explaining, which is doing what you should in practice and it not working there, but then it working here on LAN. How do you mix these two worlds?"", ""My experience is that online, people just don't care. Obviously, not when we face the good, good teams, but it's not very often that you play the really good teams online because they're just getting invites to tournaments and so on. But in my eyes, at least, and I guess SZPERO's, too. I didn't ask this question, but I guess he thinks the same way I do, and it's just that people don't care. They have a CCT event, which is now CCT East, and if they lose that game, in three hours, they have CCT West, and they play another tournament. People just seem to not care what they do."", ""For me, we've never been the consistent players at good events all the time, right? We probably played many of them, but it wasn't from event to event. But we practiced tier-one teams a lot. I learned how to play against tier-one teams in practice. We played a lot of praccs against good teams, always, so my brain operates at a good level, I would say. I understand the game on a good level, but when you play crazy teams that do careless stuff it's impossible to read. When I see that something is good, you can actually work and it makes sense, like the rotations are good and stuff, to me it's a good strat and that's why we use it on LAN even if the win rate of most of these rounds was pretty bad."", ""We also didn't show two perfect strats we have. I think we have two insane strats on Anubis, but it wouldn't work against HEROIC from our analysis, so we couldn't pull it off. It didn't make sense. Maybe when I watch the demo I will see there was a gap, actually, but from the analysis it just wasn't there to play. But yeah, it's just, you do what you gotta do, and when there's an important event we just play it."", ""You don't get to play these events that often, so tell me about the importance of being here at this event for this team."", ""Yeah, it's really important. I was happy having HEROIC in the group even though we probably shouldn't be, but to me, winning against HEROIC is a big deal when it comes to the ranking. Going to playoffs and getting the stage game and stuff is really important for the guys to get this vibe of the scene and it will benefit them and the team in the future, for me as well."", ""But I wouldn't say it's a do-or-die event. It's an event we had in the goals this season, we wanted to go to Elisa LAN. When we made our goals in March, we said we wanted to go to the Elisa tournament. We wanted to win one of the qualifiers and it happened. We also qualified for the IESF World Championship 2024..."", ""And it overlaps with the RMR."", ""And the qualifier for that was during the player break, so shout out to the organizers. I had booked a holiday and had to reschedule because I couldn't cancel it. It was a lot of money, and it was kind of a dream trip. So I had to kind of postpone the break, but you can't do it because there are events all of the time."", ""It cost me some money to reschedule this, and I had to do it in September, so they had to play one or two games with SZPERO and I came back after 10 days without touching the computer, and we had to play three best-of-threes, but we still pulled through. So we were very happy with that. The first goal is met, and now we obviously want to go to playoffs."", ""I don't think it's that tough. We're in the position that we could get there. When we came here we said, 'It could be 0-2, that's possible.' You have ENCE that didn't have a really good time this year, but they have players who can play, and if they click, they will also be a really dangerous team. We also have 9z, who is also kind of down, I think, but they can also play CS."", ""So we said, 'It could be 2-0, it could be 0-2, it could be 1-2 or whatever.' Whatever the score, we just try to gain as much as we can from this, and then the big tournament will come in a month. That's the main goal of the year. But of course, we want to go all the way."", ""What's the preparation for the RMR? That's the classic; everyone wants to peak at the RMR and the Major. What do you have lined up for that?"", ""We'll polish some maps, some that aren't perfect right now, but the real issue I have with CS is that the moment you fix something, something else is falling apart..."", ""Classic."", ""Yeah. We made a lot of progress on Anubis, which was a terrible map for us. I had no idea how bad we could be on this map, but lately it's going really well \u2014 also in officials \u2014, so we're happy with this. At the same time, we have maps that need some work, so we need to focus on that and to be honest we're fucking up individual duels."", ""Our individual level was really low, and I don't know what caused that. It wasn't just one person or so, everyone was pretty bad. This is what we really need to work on. I don't know what routine we'll have for the team, Refrag or whatever, but we'll play a lot, and we'll bootcamp on November 4 at the Rebels Center. Then we go straight to China, and hopefully, that's the moment the team peaks. But before that, I would like us to peak in here."", ""You used to have AGO and x-kom, and even the Kinguin bootcamp place which closed down. What's the health of the CS scene in Poland right now?"", ""I would call it probably non-existent. It's really surprising because when CS was, not even in VP, there was a time after VP when we had x-kom and Illuminar where we won an international LAN, we went to two DreamHacks where we could have gone far but didn't. I don't want to get into it because some interesting things happened during this time. But I don't know, the interest is lost."", ""People in charge of events are probably bad people in good shoes. I think if you had a different group organizing stuff with all of the resources they had, it would be much better, but now the CS interest is basically dead. Even with the streams. There's like five players in Poland who can sustain some good viewership numbers, but usually people don't care, and before it was completely different."", ""I don't know if it's the lack of results or the lack of everything. We had LAN tournaments, we had the ESL Polish Championship, which granted a spot at IEM Katowice. Now ESL Poland is closed. We had the Polish Esports League, but they were quite a debt to many, many people. Then, you have the organizations that are also in debt."", ""So yeah, if I had to play now for a Polish organization, I would probably decide not to play at all because it doesn't make sense. I'm still owed a big chunk of money by Anonymo, so I don't think I'd trust anyone to actually do it. They could give you a good salary and all of the other stuff, but when you have a good salary on paper but not in your bank account, then it's pretty sad. That also influenced people, I think. It influenced me a lot."", ""I wasn't depressed, that's a strong word, but waking up every day knowing that I was owed 2,000\u20ac, then five months later I was owed 20,000\u20ac, it's like what's happening. You can't focus. BLEED is in that situation now. So yeah, I think it's pretty bad for everyone. As long as it stays in its current state, I think the Polish scene will be dead anyway."", ""Well, that's sad."", ""Yeah, it is. But it's the truth and I hope that maybe when the generation changes and some of the players who know how to do it and what players expect, and they take charge of that, maybe something will change. But I don't know if there will be any interest in the Polish CS scene in Poland from sponsors and stuff."", ""Do you think Poland is just going to feed into the international scene?"", ""It's been happening for quite some time now. Any good player, especially younger players, when they get the chance, they just go. People like xKacpersky, who is here at this tournament. Six months ago, he was grinding FACEIT Premium and didn't get any offer from Polish teams, and now he's in ENCE. And the guys who were in ENCE, they did something good with 9INE. But that was kind of like one-hit wonders because they also peaked really high but then just fell down step by step and split from ENCE."", ""This was probably the only moment when there was a team that could mean something because we had some stuff before, like Anonymo with me, Snax, KEi, Kylar, and mynio, which was also okay, but we didn't use our chance. We had the Anonymo with me and Demho in the Major qualifier in 2023 or 2022 when we beat G2 on LAN. There was one round, If we had won it against Spirit, we would have qualified for the Major. So we had our chances; we just didn't use them, and 9INE was actually the team that did it."", ""Rebels is doing okay, I think, because we have really young players without much experience and they already played at IEM Katowice and then Melbourne, now we're here, then we have the RMR, so something is happening. Now we have to use this chance because if we don't, then we'll just be another Polish team."", ""Yeah, so maybe you can try and make the 9INE run now."", ""That would be really nice. You could see that the 9INE people built up a lot in Poland. They weren't that hyped players. I mean, there was a hype, but once they qualified, the whole of Poland was instantly living on CS. Some of these players sustain this hype until now, like hades, for example. Him and Snax are the two people in Poland right now, and maybe ultimate, but he doesn't have that much of a known personality, so people don't talk about him as often as they do about Snax and hades."", ""Are we not counting siuhy as Polish?"", ""Aaah, sorry!"", ""laughs"", ""But what I mean, because siuhy is not streaming, I had my eyes on when people open up the stream. If hades opens up a stream, he has likes 800 viewers instantly. Snax, like 2,000 or so. I saw ultimate streaming lately, and he had like 150, which is pretty low for the average top Polish players right now. Before that, like three years ago, when I was not in MAD Lions anymore, when I opened up my stream, I would have like 1,000 in three minutes, so it was much different then than now. But obviously, siuhy is the GOAT, so eh... Don't forget that!"", ""You do get this team that will pop up, but it seems like there used to be several teams at the same time competing, and players would move from one team to the other."", ""There's Monte, the Polish one, I think they're top 30 now, which is really good, but when I look at them I sort of see the 9INE players. They have, in my eyes, fantastic players. They could be an insane team, but they also need to become a real team instead of fantastic individuals because their players... it's tough to get a better group of players than what Monte did. Let's see how they'll go with that lineup."", ""We were kind of better, I would say, most of the time this year, but the last time we played each other, they smashed us. We obviously didn't play well. We were scared. We were somewhat the best Polish team, and perhaps we didn't want to lose it, and they completely rolled us over, but it is what it is. And now they're top 30!

We started terribly, losing in the RMR's closed qualifier, but we gradually improved as the season went on, so let's hope the same is true this time."", ""What do you think this is due to? Does it have to do with the team's move to Europe, perhaps?"", ""I really don't know. I wish I did, but I really don't.

But from what I've seen so far, he's only improving and it goes really fast. You have these type of players, you also saw it with device being away for a year and also with my time with ZywOo, that those players just have that raw talent where it will kinda always be there."", ""One day they might lose the motivation, but if they are hungry and they want to prove themselves, then I have a hard time seeing that they don't find their way back to a very very strong level. As I said before, I don't expect him to come back to the Sasha that we know, I think he needs a little bit more time, but he's definitely qualified to play for Falcons."", ""The hunger was something that people were questioning about s1mple in the past year. He made it no secret that CS2 wasn't to his liking and he was a big critic of the game. It took a lot of time to be able to come back. Was that a worry for you as well when you were approaching this discussion?"", ""Not really. We have had some talks with him throughout this season, and we also played with him back in March. I think he's very eager to come back. Unfortunately, I think personal issues, this guy probably hasn't had the easiest last couple of years with the situation going on in his home country. I've also had this talk with him where he kinda got robbed of having this era or trying to challenge our time back in Astralis, because they were doing so well in 2021 and then the war broke out."", ""Now he's had some time to get a well-needed break, and I think he's ready to come back. When you get so much time on the sidelines, I tried it as well when I retired as a player, and you see that the scene is just moving on without you... Now he's had some time to rest, fix some stuff for him and his family, and how he's ready to come back and compete."", ""What's the plan here? s1mple has been announced as being on loan until the end of the year. Could you see a future where he stays on the team permanently after that?"", ""I'm not gonna go too much into details with this. We're here right now and my only focus is the RMR. I think for me and for the team it's really important that we qualify for the Major, that's the only thing that can somewhat save our season, so I haven't thought too much about next year. I would rather not comment on that. I just wanna say that a guy like this is always someone that you'd consider."", ""You've had a couple of officials now online and have been practicing for a while. How has it been going with s1mple, what have you seen in him so far?"", ""I've seen a guy who is progressing on a daily basis. I know the results didn't really showcase that, but we've chosen to play these tournaments based on him getting some official practice as well. We would have loved a better start, but, to be fair to him, it was definitely not his fault that we lost those two games. I think he did phenomenally, thinking about how long he's been away. It's just good to see that in practice, that he adapts to the way the game is being played. He was out for quite some time and it's also a new game on top of that, but you can see that he's definitely not been away from the game, that he has been following and also grinding a lot lately."", ""Are there no worries that he's behind on the team meta, or has it been okay?"", ""For a guy who has been away for so long, you can definitely see that he's still watching a lot of games. Maybe there was a down period when it comes to him playing FACEIT, but I think the last month and a half, if people go in and check, he's been playing pretty much 24/7. I'm actually surprised about how far ahead he is in that regard. Of course there are some suggestions from him like, they did this utility back in NAVI or whatever, and we kinda know that, nowadays, that doesn't work, we also did that in Vitality and in CS2 it just doesn't work. But I'm positively surprised by how he is when it comes to playing the game."", ""Talking about ESL Challenger, it's kind of a stepping stone for you leading up to the RMR. Is that how you are treating this, as a way to get s1mple into the system and give him more time, or are you aiming high as well?"", ""Obviously, it's kind of a mix of both, but the primary target here is to just get some matches under the belt for him. He's here to help us try and reach the Major, and then we'll see afterwards. For me the way we have been practicing has not been with the aim of being as good as possible for Thunderpick and for this tournament. We're practicing the maps we need in order for us to improve and not specifically our next opponent, so in that regard the RMR is the big target here."", ""You're speaking as if just getting to the Major would be enough and, as you said, somewhat save your season. How are you treating the rest of the year and the Shanghai Major in particular? Is there any hope that you could be pretty competitive by that time, or are you just riding out the season and seeing how it's going to develop into the next year?"", ""Of course with the players that we have, dupreeh who attended all Majors in CS:GO, Magisk who was Anchor of the Year last year, and obviously Sasha, the GOAT of CS:GO, I think it would be naive to say that we wouldn't like to do well. But I also think we need to be a bit more realistic, both in terms of how our year has been but also not putting pressure on ourselves. It has been a rough year for all of us, and I think going in and saying, 'yeah, we wanna hit playoffs at the Major,' that's disrespectful to all the teams who are doing really well right now, but also taking it lightly, because qualifying for the Major is by far the biggest test to any team."", ""Even when we were number one in Vitality last year, it was probably more scary for us to go to the RMR, especially in Paris, than the Major itself. At the Major you kinda reached that goal, and this is where you can take it one game at a time, but at the RMR you're just afraid of failing, afraid of not making, afraid of having to watch the Major from home. That is a tough feeling, one that I also experienced last season. For me it's taking it one step at a time, but of course if we do qualify, then let's pray for miracles. I hope everything can happen, but for now it's about going there."", ""There have been reports of moves already happening for the team heading into 2025, suggesting NiKo will join the team.

It's about the here and now and about trying to perform, set these goals that we've always been doing, both me and Lars, in Astralis, in Vitality and now here in Falcons. We have a task given by Falcons and we want to become the best team in the world; sometimes that doesn't work out.

It's a stepping stone for you before the RMR and coming in with a player change, what's your mindset and expectation going into this tournament?"", ""I think for us it's a preparation tournament for the RMR, that's our main goal. We barely had any practice with Ag1l, he arrived and we had to play ECL Challenger online recently, and we did a bootcamp just to get everything to know each other. He knew the other two kids already, but he didn't know me and MUT so well, so we did a bootcamp to play the tournament. I feel like he's fitting perfectly in the team.

It seems like the split with arrozdoce hasn't been very amicable, there's a bit of bad blood there. How did this come about, and how do you justify having to make a change this close to a Major?"", ""For me, the things weren't done correctly on arrozdoce's side, but I'm all good with him, whatever. We felt like the team wasn't as happy as it was before, and knowing that he wanted to leave at the end of the season, and all things were done, we felt like we had to change it instantly. Most people weren't happy with how we were playing and how things were done, and we just needed something new and something to start over, and we just didn't wanna wait for the next season.

Back to BERRY, in Cologne he did a great job, he was a really great coach and he prepared the games perfectly against every opponent we had.

It's been a year since you played on LAN on any sort of serious level. How was the feeling going into this project?"", ""It was good because I played a lot of FACEIT. I was practicing my aim a lot and the game changed as well, it is more smooth, especially on LAN there is no freeze and no lag. Everything is really good. I miss it because the last time I played was at ESL Pro League in CS:GO, and I wanted to play at LAN just to feel how it goes, and it was beautiful (laughs)."", ""It's not the same as online when you are playing with an anti-cheat, even the tournament we played online had an anti-cheat, so I had a freeze sometimes. When you feel like your game isn't working 100%, you're just losing confidence with your moves sometimes, but at LAN everything is different."", ""So how are you feeling about the game? You were a pretty harsh critic at the beginning and it seemed like it was also holding you back in terms of your motivation to come back. How are you feeling about the state of the game now?"", ""I wouldn't say that it held my motivation back, but it's become much better now. They just need to fix some AWP shots. I saw w0nderful from NAVI and I also had similar situations when we played scrims and we were shooting in the right direction, but the bullets just disappeared."", ""Overall, I think everything is fine. What can they fix? Maybe they'll need to remove some maps like Vertigo, the maps that everyone plays the least. But I think CS is in good shape right now, much better than it was at the Copenhagen Major."", ""How are you feeling in terms of catching up to the meta? As you said, the game's changed quite a bit since the arrival of CS2. I also spoke to zonic and he was talking about some situations where you have some ideas that are more from CS:GO. Do you feel like it's gonna take you a bit of time to catch up or do you think you're close to that?"", ""I think I'm close to that. It's basically the same for me right now, just this thing when you smoke and Molotov and you can go in front of the smoke, and that's it. And of course, blowing nades in certain spots. For example, from Short, you can bounce the nade and extinguish the door smoke. I think I just need to learn more nades overall, that's my priority right now, to get more nades on different maps."", ""Tell me about this Falcons opportunity overall. You were talking about how your big goal is the RMR, and your loan only lasts until the end of the year. Can you tell me about what the plans and expectations are here for the longer term? Is there a world where you could stay beyond the Shanghai Major?"", ""Oh, I hope so laughs. I don't know because we never spoke about it. But first of all thanks to NAVI for the opportunity to let me play, and of course thanks to Falcons for the invitation right before the RMR roster lock. I'll try to do my best, but our main goal and my personal goal as a team is to be in the top eight of the Shanghai Major at least."", ""I feel we can do it, but we just need to upgrade our map pool. We are trying to feel each other and find this synergy because it's the first time I met the guys. Even when I played as a stand-in for one match against Metizport, I never met them in real life, and now it's a whole different experience."", ""We just need more time. It would be amazing to beat Eternal Fire, I don't know if they are top 5 or top 6 on the HLTV rankings right now, but still, they're better than us and they deserve the win more. They've been together much longer and they had so much experience, even against NAVI on LAN, when they lost the best-of-five, they were so close to beating them on Dust2, and NAVI's Dust2 is one of the best."", ""I feel CS is in the shape where any team can beat any team right now. Of course, the most consistent team for me is NAVI, and after that are all other teams like G2, FaZe, and Spirit. But anyone can just take a step forward and beat NAVI once, and they'll be on the same level. As I said, everyone can beat any team, and the team that is practicing the most and sticking together as players has the best chance, like it was before."", ""It took you a year to finally get an opportunity to return. How worried were you at that time that it could be it for you because there was a big buyout from NAVI? A lot of people were probably also thinking it's a big gamble to get you into their team because of the big investment after a year out of the game. Were you worried at some point that this could be it?"", ""Of course. Because I wasn't playing, not getting experience. Before I didn't play CS every day, but now when I started to play CS everyday for almost one and a half months, I feel my power. I feel my individual performance, but it's still not enough to beat teams, because when you play officials, it's a completely different game to FACEIT."", ""I'm not very happy, but I'm pretty okay with what I'm showing as an individual. I'm still making some mistakes as a team player, but I think we need time. As I said, this opportunity is so good because how can I show myself if nobody can buy me, and I can play only FACEIT with fucking lag laughs. It's so nice to be back on LAN, and even if we lost today it didn't destroy my confidence or mentality, because we are new as a team and we will have enough time to prepare for the Major."", ""Lastly, I want to ask you about NAVI. As you were saying, they are now the most consistent team. From when people were thinking that they fluked the Major, they've become quite clearly the best team in the world. How does that make you feel because it's the team you left, it's the team you've been on the bench for. What kind of feelings do you have about that?"", ""I feel like they became mentally stronger as players, especially after the Copenhagen win. Of course, they're doing well. Everyone is saying they don't have superstars, but I think they have superstars, it's just always different superstars at different points. I'm pretty sure all of them are working so hard to achieve what they achieved, and it's an incredible result with six finals in a row."", ""I'm just looking forward to playing against them. Their games in every final were so close, it could be even six wins six wins in a row for them, or it could be six losses as well. It's interesting how they're gonna show themselves in Shanghai, and maybe we'll face them if we finally win at least one map laughs. I think we have the same group, so there is a possibility that if we win two best-of-ones and they win two best-of-ones, we can face each other in a best-of-three.

We have been in the top five all year with a young team. We started practicing with sh1ro in January. So we have been together for nine months. We are still getting good results even if we are in bad shape. We can get through the group stage and into playoffs. And it's a good result, I would say."", ""For me, this season is already successful. But we can make it more so by winning this tournament and the Major. We will see how it goes."", ""You're going to play Vitality in the first round. Do you think this is a good matchup for you guys, considering they are playing with a stand-in and may not be in the best shape? Or do you think it can make them unpredictable?"", ""We don't think about it. Vitality is Vitality. They have a stand-in but they have four other players who can make a difference. We will not underestimate them because they have a stand-in. We will look at them as if they had their default lineup. We are just playing against Vitality. We don't care that they have a stand-in. We just want to show our game and that's it."", ""This is your first full year of playing Counter-Strike at the highest level. How do you look back at everything that has happened? The MVPs, the titles, everything. Are you happy with the way that you've been playing this year? And where do you see yourself in 2025?"", ""Basically, I see myself in 2025 being more consistent than I have been this year. I could have played better than I have been playing in the second half of the year. We faced problems. But I feel that I could have performed better, and maybe in some matches that we lost I could have changed the result. But in general, it has been a good year for me. I'm okay with this. I know I can be better and I can perform better. It's kind of annoying for me that sometimes I perform badly. I want to become more consistent.  Just better.""]}",1730213100000,/news/40152/donk-we-were-able-to-fix-our-problems-i-think-weve-improved-as-a-team

In Rio, even jL joked a little bit about how players were a little bit tired of each other because they had been together for such a long period. With this in mind, did you use the time between Rio and this event to get some rest?"", ""Yes, we always use this kind of rest time if we have the option. Ideally, it's always six days after the tournament. If we have this opportunity, we always use it, and then we balance it. If we see that there is not enough practice, we will take fewer days off and do a little bit more practice. This time, we needed a lot, because it was like three tournaments in a row. Between BLAST and Rio, we had maybe two or three days at home. We used some days off, and I wish we could have more time for prep."", ""What can you say about the preparation for the event? You said you wish you had more time to prep. Was it just online practice or did you have a small bootcamp before this one?"", ""No, no bootcamp, only online. Especially because the RMR is on the horizon, and there is a huge chance that we will stay there for more time, so it can be a lot of time in one hotel in an unordinary country for Europeans. It can be tough. So, we decided to not do a bootcamp, but I think we will have a bootcamp before the RMR. We will have some days at home, maybe two, and then straight to bootcamp. It depends on how we do in this tournament."", ""How are you looking at this event? Are you taking more of a relaxed approach? Because for some teams the issue is not getting burned out just before the Major and the RMR, which will be in China. What is your approach to this tournament?"", ""We never have any kind of relaxed mode in any tournament. At least it's not what we speak about, how we try to change or tune our mindset. This tournament will be the same as all others, except for the fact that we maybe didn't have enough preparation. The only thing we need to focus on is not to concentrate too much on the streak of finals, that's the most important part."", ""It is clear that NAVI have been the number one team in the world, even though you had a lot of ups and downs in the first half of the season. Why do you think other teams haven't been able to find the sort of consistency that you've been able to in the past couple of months?"", ""I'm actually a little bit surprised that Vitality and G2 didn't find any stability. It means that something doesn't work in their camp, their office, let's say. But I don't know what, because it's all behind the curtain, I can only speak about us. I think we just try to focus a lot on sticking to a system, improving the system, correcting a little bit all the time, and just focusing on playing with the best quality we can. We have this conversation constantly after each game, to have a routine and a real process."", ""Back in Dallas, during a very low point of the season for you, you said that if things didn't improve, there would have to be changes. Looking back, are you surprised with the way that the team bounced back and that you've been able to have these grand final streaks and all these tournament titles in the past couple of months?"", ""Yes, a huge result, obviously. We also had London before as a good, positive sign. We didn't think that we would be here with six finals in a row after London and Riyadh, it's kind of extraordinary on some scale. If you would look at the competitive scene at the beginning of the season, even in January or after the summer break, it was still the same amount of potential in the scene, the same amount of competitiveness and talent, like raw talent."", ""Teams were getting better and better, many other new teams were created. The scene is constantly improving and changing, and it's getting bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger, which means it will be more difficult with each tournament. Also, there is a tendency that everyone is studying the team at the top, and that's why it will be even more difficult. Considering all these factors, for me, it's a huge achievement and very extraordinary."", ""You've said many times just how important it is for the team to have long bootcamps before big tournaments. What sort of plan did you come up with to make sure that you are going to be in top shape for the RMRs and the Major? For example, Liquid are staying here in Asia, which is a very risky decision. What is it like for you before the Major?"", ""I think staying in Asia is quite risky. We want to prioritize our mental state. With this lineup, I'm always trying to balance the schedule, to see people's relative gaps to rest, to reset, and to be mentally stable and hungry enough to have enthusiasm in the game. I think it's crucial, especially in the tier-one scene, when you play semifinals and finals."", ""For us, bootcamps are crucial. For me, it's very comfortable, because I know how it works, and I know every step. I know how much time we usually need before the tournament to balance all the maps, how to balance and structure all the days, and how we can grow day by day to have enough time to change something if we see some huge problems during the bootcamp. It's also comfortable because it's not the first one. You're doing maybe 12, or maybe even more, and you're constantly tracking, analyzing each one, and you know that for the system, bootcamps are very important because we're building our strategy, synergy, communication, and everything else."", ""It's more comfortable for me to control the progress of the team. When we're constantly at tournaments and online, especially in the finals, when you don't have enough days off or even days to practice, it is quite challenging. You need to find specific moments, real chances to analyze the meta and add things meta-wise to your strat book, so it will also not be hostile to the system, or not comfortable for players to do, because you cannot add any style you want."", ""It was a very limited time gap, where we needed to analyze what is happening with the other teams, what is happening in terms of really cool gimmicks, meta-wise changes, and add it to our system and strat book. We also needed to analyze our mistakes and fix them, because our system relies or depends a lot on fixing our mistakes.  Sometimes we discuss even more about the problems and not what we should add, just what didn't work, and that's why these three tournaments were really hard for us. The schedule is very tight, that's true."", ""I can say the best bootcamp we had for sure was before Copenhagen Major. It was perfect, it was full, how it should be. Since then, we only had one before Riyadh for five days, not the length we really wanted. Even now before the RMR, if we were in Group B, it would be amazing, it would be perfect. But we are not, so we will have maybe seven days of bootcamp, it's not bad. We still will try to optimize everything and squeeze as much as possible. I think it will be enough to reset, but I don't know what would be better. To lose this tournament and be hungrier before bootcamp, or maybe it's better to win and be more confident, but I think if we win this one, it can be too much confidence for us."", ""We can be overconfident before getting into the best-of-ones at the RMR, but we always work on this to stay realistic and not be delusional, because we know that the scene is very competitive and you can lose to anyone. Usually, when we speak about this, it's not like we are just saying this, we are really focusing. It's a very fragile situation, and we need to keep working, keep trying. It doesn't mean that we are unbeatable. These things are really important nowadays."", ""You are going to face Astralis in your first matchup, you destroyed them in Cologne and they have not won a series yet with cadiaN. Do you think that this is a good matchup for you to get warmed up for the rest of the tournament? Are you confident?"", ""Let's say that out of all the teams, I think this one will not be as difficult as the others, that's for sure. This is I think an objective opinion because they have a new line-up, and they are also experimenting or implementing a new system. If you read their interviews, like device, talking about one thing, cadiaN other things, so they need to find the ground beneath them, and to feel it very firmly."", ""I don't know, maybe they already found it, and they are standing very still and firm, but maybe not, and from what we saw before, for sure it's not the same danger as Liquid or Spirit for example. The scene is very very strong, and when any of the teams that are in this tournament lose, they are very hungry for the next tournament. If they lose one more time, they are even hungrier, so it's like they're gaining mana constantly."", ""I want to ask you a little bit about s1mple. He just came back, he's now playing for Falcons. What do you think about his choice of team, because you said that maybe he needed to take a step back and play for a tier-two team to get his form back? With that in mind, do you think that Falcons is the right team for him at this stage in his career?"", ""It depends on what his choices were. I'm not sure there were any other choices, maybe there was one more team other than Falcons, but obviously, Falcons has a lot of money, and I think it's a huge factor, It's all about the perspective of Sasha s1mple, it's all about his values, his vision of his future, progress, and his comeback. For sure, he has his own strategy, it doesn't mean it's good or bad, It means it's his own, so it's very hard to say from outside the process. But it's not bad, for sure it's a very very decent opportunity to come back into tier-one, he has the most respectable and winning coach, he has a very experienced IGL, and Magisk is a solid player, always stable, for sure like a tier-one anchor."", ""dupreeh has huge experience, a five-time Major winner. Maden is a player who has shown some good results. He's also trying to find some ground, and his potential for sure was not reached, but with these pieces it's possible to build something, it's just about a good approach. I think they have a lot of pressure, and with this pressure, it's really hard to play. I wouldn't like to be in their position, because I think the amount of investment creates this pressure. Imagine the same lineup but with a different budget, I think it's all about this because people understand what kind of money they can get back."", ""Have you seen any of his games for Falcons?"", ""Yes, I didn't see any from the beginning to the end, because we had practice and we also needed time to rest, but I was watching some rounds. There were different games, one was online, and two were on LAN. It was rough. I think there were a lot of mistakes, somebody also said in the interview that they aren't good enough as a team yet. We need to understand that nowadays that is the most important thing. I can even say that I think we are winning because of this, because we are good as a team, and if we are showing stable results, it for sure proves to you that this is a meta factor nowadays."", ""You can see that, for example, teams like Vitality hugely rely on ZywOo, Spirit hugely rely on donk, and G2 on NiKo. For you, you don't have a clear star player, and you function well as a team."", ""Yes, and I really think that it's not the future of Counter-Strike in my opinion, because it's really hard to build a game around star players. You must build something around the team, you must try to have a goal, or the team must adapt and sacrifice more to play for one player. It's not so good to rely on one player. If he's not good, it's not a good strategy."", ""Having a strong group of five players who are trying to execute ideas on the same page is for sure more complex, more stable, and more efficient. In the same priority of roles, nobody is trying to be the best in the round, so it's all about you having an idea in the round. In this round, for example, this player must be the main factor, he must be a playmaker, and it's not always Mihai iM, for example. It's not always like this, it can be on another side, it can be some idea where lurkers will try to pop up at some point."", ""So Falcons are not good as a team, in my opinion, and at the same time, I think it's not so easy to fix.  About the idea of how to fix this, it would be another answer for like 5-10 minutes, because it's very, very difficult. We always speak about this, people come from different backgrounds, with different knowledge on how to have the same reactions, all this stuff. You can see teams like Eternal Fire sometimes have decent success, I think also because they are playing as a team. I think why, for example, SAW played well in Cologne, also because they showed some good dynamics during the tournament as a team. Nowadays, if teams want to be really good, they need to focus on this."", ""One of the biggest talking points in recent months following your success as a team is whether zonic is still the greatest coach of all time or whether you deserve to be in that conversation. How do you look at that? Where do you think you stand in the conversation in terms of the greatest coach of all time?"", ""I actually don't think about this. When I try to, I understand there is no point, because if you win three Majors in a row and five overall, it's a phenomenal result. So no matter what I do, until I have the same, it's very subjective. It's very subjective to put myself somewhere in a good position. So I immediately stop thinking about it, because I'm just focusing a lot on the process. And I also ask the team to do the same, constantly think about the process, not about the result."", ""We recently did an interview with npl, who's now doing really well with B8. Did you think that he would be playing this well right after leaving NAVI, joining B8, and taking over as an IGL? Did you think that he would be an IGL material?"", ""He also said in that same interview that he thinks that the IGL of the future is going to be more of a playmaker, someone who calls also for himself, and not just someone like Aleksib or Snappi. Do you agree with him?"", ""I didn't expect him to be an IGL overall. I don't even remember having this conversation or this idea. We didn't speak about this in NAVI Junior, or with aMi, or with another coach. We never thought about this, so it's quite interesting that he decided to do this. At this young age, it's very rare. There is a lack of IGLs, obviously, and the more IGLs there are in the scene, the better."", ""Speaking about IGLs who can be more playmakers. You know, if you speak about the T side, every IGL is in a playmaker role, as a second playmaker. So, for example, on Mirage the IGL is usually on Mid. If you speak about Inferno, IGL is around Banana on the T side. If you speak about Nuke, IGL is around Outside, he's kind of supporting the playmaker."", ""So I think he is speaking more about being a full playmaker., like Mihai iM... MOUZ's playmaker is xertioN, for example. In Vitality, they change sometimes, but I think FlameZ is now doing it, and apEX is also doing the same role sometimes. For Liquid, it's Twistzz. donk is doing it in Spirit, so it's still a little bit raw, it's not stable."", ""There was also an article the other day on HLTV about stats and roles. Speaking about roles, it's still very, very raw. So to have something like this, you need to have really set roles. And I really think that nowadays you can still change. With a proper system, if the system is designed well, I think you can change roles, analyze the players, and give correct ideas."", ""He's also saying that this is the future, but I think it's an impulsive idea. It's something like he's in the process of and he sees this at this moment, at this age. But I think he can change his idea because he needs to try different things also. In my opinion, I have been thinking about this for maybe the last three years. That IGLs, at least in my system, are not the crucial part."", ""In terms of fragging or\u2026"", ""In terms of calling. Because I honestly think that nowadays in the tier-one scene, it's impossible to control the game in the way you should if you want to win against a very strong team. In my vision, in my system, it's not possible to have enough time to discuss something in rounds. So players must have, most of the time, their own ideas of what to do."", ""It's impossible for an IGL to initiate everything. For example, if you take us. It's impossible for Aleksib to constantly initiate Mihai iM. He will never feel the same amount of timing, the same amount of space, sounds, everything. This moment is about milliseconds, especially on big stages where we used to say there's a loss between synergies, there's a loss of package, and it's crucial to have this independence in the team."", ""That's why what he's saying can be correct, because in my system it works for sure. It's not something you can rely on if you constantly want one player to control everyone. Even when I was playing, it was impossible. With a very good sniper, who can make decisions and calls, a very good playmaker and IGL, and lurkers. For us, b1t sometimes speaks so well, has such a good vision of what to do, and he just does it."", ""We had these situations so many times and didn't take advantage, and we fixed them. Sometimes, a player can ask and he will not get a response, and then the timing is off, or he can ask and it will be denied, and then you see the demo and see it was the correct call. Then for sure, it's better to go, and then check the quality of the play later, you give yourself more chances this way."", ""kassad said he sees the future with no IGL, just two playmakers. Is that something you feel can work?"", ""This is kind of risky. I tried it in Gambit who didn't have an IGL, and no one wanted to take the role. I was really surprised and said okay, let's try to build around defaults, and then maybe people will try to communicate, and it should be fine. I saw at that moment that it kind of works, you just need more quality, but there was some potential. So it's possible for sure, it's all about knowledge of the team, preparation, game plan, synergy, and balance of the system. It's all about the system because without it, the model won't work.""]}",1730217600000,/news/40154/b1ad3-if-we-win-this-one-it-can-be-too-much-confidence-for-us

It is against the teams we want to compete against and face off with and we want to compete with, so in that sense everything is fine, but of course the circumstances surrounding everything have been a bit tough."", ""I'm not sure, of course you always hope for a good start, but you can feel that everyone is on the same page and we're learning day by day. The main goal was also not to be the best from one week or two weeks in, it was to have longevity, and I think we're aiming towards that."", ""Do you think it's just a matter of time? The team doesn't seem to be gelling, are you still trying to make all of the pieces fit?"", ""I'm not sure if I agree that the team doesn't seem to be gelling. I think that, of course, we've had losses, but to good teams. I don't think we lost to any teams that are bad."", ""It's more the way you've lost some of the games."", ""Yeah, but, other than the Vitality game, there aren't any maps that have been clear cut. If you look at the games, they're all close. The VP one, the HEROIC one, the Spirit one, and if you look at our pistol stats, and I'm usually not the guy bringing this up, but if you look at the pistol stats I think that they definitely aren't going in our favor."", ""We won two out of ten in Rio and with how CS2 is currently, with MR12 and the economy, pistol rounds are super vital and something we tried to look at when we got home. Again, it's not the only reason we lost the games, but it could have played a part in some of the map losses."", ""In a recent interview device said that your system is still something that needs time to get used to. Have you been working with him to make him more comfortable in the game?"", ""Yeah, of course. I think he is one of the primary factors to unlocking the key to success, so we're having a lot of dialogue and I'm trying to make him as comfortable as possible."", ""He is allowing a lot of space to be taken, so I think it's also up to the rest of the players to enable him to get into good situations by creating space in the rounds because I think that device also has aggressive moves and is good at making them, but he's also known for being a really good turret on the CT positions. That means that the rest of us should search for information, play a bit aggressively, and allow him to have that role because he has a lot of impact."", ""Also, I think that the level he has shown in practice isn't something that has shown to the same extent in officials yet, but that's just a matter of time because this guy and his resume, it has nothing to do with practice and official, it's just about getting more reps and giving him more time to get used to the system."", ""With your move to Astralis also came a role change for you. You're now a rifling IGL, you've averaged a .77 rating since joining the team. Has it been harder for you than expected to have this new role?"", ""Yes and no. I think there are some positions that have been difficult. Sometimes it has also been on the T side, kind of getting used to... I mean, I've been in the map control pack, but I'm in a different position in the map control pack now, running in first and understanding the timings of some of those situations."", ""I think that if you look at my POV of all of the games, my aim and the way I play is more than up to the level of a rifling in-game leader. We had some tough draws and we have way more losses than wins, and that's always going to show in the statistics. The teams that have the best statistics are the teams that are winning, so of course that's going to change when the wins start to come our way."", ""With a lot of things to fix and not a lot of time until the Major, what have you prioritized since Rio?"", ""First and foremost there have been many details added to the structure of rounds, there have been way more names and setups, which is not just on-the-fly things, but more categories and boxes. We talked a lot about philosophies on different maps, as well. That's something that has been a priority, and I think that kind of closing out man advantage situations and post-plants."", ""We try to do as much as possible with little time, but to be completely honest I think that the best version of Astralis is not going to happen in 2024, it'll happen on the other side of next year. That doesn't mean we can't have a good performance here, or that we can't have a good run at the Major, but in terms of the estimate of how long it takes a team to become good, it is under tough circumstances to expect it to be now. Even with me having a history with stavn and jabbi, I still need to adjust to ruggah, Staerh, and device."", ""You're now going up against NAVI in the first round, which is hardly the easiest matchup, given they're the number one team in the world. What are your thoughts on this matchup?"", ""Nobody is expecting us to do much against them. They've shown to be the best team of 2024. A lot of noise, a lot of circumstance regarding their Major win, with everyone calling them a fluke, but they've proven that their system works. The entire debate about not having a star player is exactly the same debate we had when we played in HEROIC and were the world's number one. People were saying the same thing, but you can see how much impact each of them is able to have in their position. So, of course, it's going to be a tough matchup, but I'm expecting us to do our best, and I think it's also possible to beat them, but of course they're big favorites and they should be so."", ""What goals have you set for this tournament? Make it out of the group stage and reach the arena? Or are you more worried about showing some positives and showing improvement before the RMR and the Major?"", ""In both my time in HEROIC and now here in Astralis, we don't make result-oriented goals at a tournament. We look at the process and things that will help us achieve the results that we talk about internally. So we've set goals both inside the server and outside the server on how we want to behave and act as a team, how we want to be playing the game, and we hope to fulfill as many of those goals as possible. But again, I think that coming into this tournament, nobody is going to expect us to do much."", ""For us it's way more about learning how to activate ourselves in the best way possible. We see it often in practice, I think it's still a bit of a rollercoaster, like we see the highs and we see the lows also in practice, but throughout the last one-and-a-half weeks before coming here we've seen way more highs so I think we're trending in the right way."", ""Lastly, one of the biggest talking points about Astralis is whether you're able to lead this team to the Major. Astralis has missed the last three Majors, which is obviously a very big deal for an organization like yours. This also puts a lot of pressure on the team and we saw at the last RMR the impact that all of this pressure can have on the team. Is the team and the staff already discussing a way to deal with all of this pressure when the RMR kicks off?"", ""Of course, it's something we've been debating, and we know the importance. Financially, for the organization, but also for the players individually.

Because for a young player who doesn't have a lot of experience, I imagine it's very hard to try to change your playstyle."", ""When he first joined, he was super confident. And having a more inexperienced player come in and be really confident, even around players that are more known and more experienced than he is, I think that just shows that his mindset is that he is confident and that he believes in what he does and how he plays the game. And I think it's important for him to come into the tier-1 playstyle, play his game, and let him make mistakes, if they're big mistakes, small mistakes, just let him make them, and then that's where we kind of help him in fixing those and just telling him."", ""And, of course, he came from tier-2 Counter Strike, playing on a Polish team, whereas he's now in tier-1. I think that throughout the first tournaments that he played, a lot of people didn't really know too much about him and what to expect from him. He was making a lot of plays and catching players off-guard, and people were seeing that he was really good, that he had sick mechanics and the way he aimed and all that."", ""But in recent events and in recent times, I think a lot of people are somewhat catching on and watching how he plays. He is a super confident player who likes to go for his peeks and all that, and I think a lot of people are studying that and seeing that, and now they're finding ways to counter him and are understanding him. So that's where he needs to understand and adapt to the tier-1 playstyle, that you need to find different ways and different avenues and different timings to get kills and outplay your opponent."", ""That more comes from learning. Then again, he's only been playing in the tier-1 scene for a couple of months now. So I think people have to cut him some slack. But I think he's been doing pretty well overall and he has a great mindset, a great attitude. He's always willing to improve and do better. I think he'll definitely be one of the future stars, for sure."", ""But how do you look at him on the server? Do you think there have been some changes compared to your first tournaments with him? Or is he still the same player, going for the same peeks and having the same approach to the game?"", ""I think he somewhat still has the same approach to the game, and I think with these last events I think he's slowly starting to understand that he might need to change his playstyle in some areas. Maybe his numbers don't look exactly the same as they did at the start, and I'm sure he knows that and I'm sure he's disappointed and I know he's working really hard to try his best to get back to that type of form and just understand how to outplay his opponents and get the kills and the statistics that he needs. All I can say is that I know he's working hard and we're trying to help him as much as we can. And we just need to keep moving forward, pretty much."", ""Before the match, YEKINDAR was asked about his personal struggles, and he said that a lot of it is down to mental issues. Don't you think it is a worrying sign that two of your players, including your AWPer, are going through a bit of a struggle just before the Major?"", ""Obviously, it's no surprise. We can all see it. We're not going to be blind about it. ultimate is having his, like, rough patch of form and I'm sure he can fix it. With YEKINDAR\u2026 I don't know. I don't think too much about it. I always believe in my teammates and what they can do. I always believe that they'll come back and all that stuff. But of course, when it comes to performances and all that, when you kind of have multiple players missing, it can be hard to win games."", ""At the end of the day, we're all making mistakes somewhat. For me, it's always just a team thing. I don't think we should pick out one player or two players or whatever, but of course, when the public and everybody on the outside is looking in, they're looking at these players and they might call them out. I try my best not to think about that type of stuff. It's just a team thing and we need to work on it. If we get better as a team, I think they'll also improve as individuals. I think it's just a team thing that needs to be worked on, and if those things can be worked on, I think it can help them in their individual form. And we just need to, as I said, come together. I think the biggest thing is more of a team thing than just individuals, but of course, individuals need to play well."", ""It was announced just before the tournament started that you guys are going to bootcamp here. Obviously, I understand not wanting to travel to Europe and then back here in just a week, and trying to beat the jet lag. But aren't you a bit worried about the quality of practice you'll find here?"", ""Of course, the quality of practice won't be too good. But luckily, in recent times, a lot of Asian teams have gotten better. You have The MongolZ, I think you have other teams. Rare Atom, TYLOO\u2026 Of course, people are going to look at us and say, 'Oh, why are they not going back to Europe? They're in their bad form and they're not really playing well or showing results. Why don't they go back to Europe and practice?' But for me and the team, it's different because with the European RMR it's a lot later. They can actually go back and be there for two weeks, whereas if we go back then we're adjusting to things and we only have a couple of days to do it. So it doesn't really make too much sense."", ""At the same time, I can understand people arguing the other way around, but there are positives and negatives on both sides if you look at it from the big picture of things. I think there is somewhat good practice here in Asia, and we should be able to at least make it through the RMR, and then when we're at the RMR, and we are able to qualify for the Major, the European teams will be coming to China and will be playing, so we'll have our opportunity to practice and be ready for the Major when that time comes. I think there are some positives to it, but I of course see the negatives."", ""Given the team's current struggles, what sort of expectations do you guys have for the RMR and the Major?"", ""As I said, we at Liquid didn't make the last Major, and obviously, that was a huge blow. So hopefully, we can at least make the Major. It's been a while since I've made the playoffs at a Major. I'd love to at least have set the goal to at least make the playoffs. But of course, with our current form, it can be a little shaky and it can be very doubtful. We just need to put the work in. And it's all event-to-event. Who knows? We could show up and be in twice the form that we are in now or even more. So, we just need to find our way and show up. And, of course, it's a Major, it's a big event. That's where you need to play with balls. And I'm ready for it. That's how it's going to be for us, I guess.""]}",1730398980000,/news/40171/naf-its-disappointing-where-we-are-right-now

You came into the event with just two practice games with JACKZ. He's playing also a different role, but you guys are still playing well. What is the secret?"", ""JACKZ is playing some of his positions, though, some maps on the CT side, and some on the T side are a bit harder. Because he is more like an entry and not a lurker. He is trying to adapt to our play and we're adapting to his play. That's what I'm trying to do. Sometimes we're talking a lot. We're really good friends, we see each other a lot and we speak about CS a lot in general in real life. So I know what he likes and what he wants to do. So I try to adapt to him as much as possible and really put myself on the side and just try to be the best that I can be to help him."", ""And do you think that the fact that you are playing with a stand-in, which takes away some of the pressure, is helping you to make it this far in this tournament?"", ""I don't think so, to be honest. I don't think it's about that. Maybe, but I don't see it that way. Let's be honest, this second part of the year we could have won, like, three tournaments already. We could be with NAVI fighting. But we lose those close games all the time, and that really hurts."", ""We haven't found a solution to win those close games yet. I think we have probably lost 80 percent of those games this year. That's really painful. We know we're playing with a stand-in, but I told my teammates I don't really care about it. I know what we're capable of, and with the team we have, with the players we have, we can win tournaments with a stand-in as well."", ""This has been a bit of a rough tournament for you individually. Is there anything going on? How do you analyze your performances so far?"", ""I think I want to do really well, and sometimes I have to explain things to JACKZ on the fly. I want to give him some freedom, but I want him to feel really well, also individually. That's why I prefer sacrificing myself for him. It's not easy, that's for sure. I have not been playing that well, except maybe that last map. I'm not satisfied with myself. Far from that."", ""I know I can do much better, mostly on the CT side because I have good positions and I know people criticize me a lot for my positions. But when you look at some maps, we have really good CT sides where I play the star player. I may not have the best stats but we are really good on some CT sides. So that's what matters to me, and stepping up a bit would be nice for the next games."", ""What has it been like to play with JACKZ? He's a good friend of yours. Some people laughed when he told me on media day that he still thinks he can play one or two more years at the highest level. He's been playing well in this tournament, he's having his moments. What is your opinion about his level?"", ""Well, it's HLTV people or analysts, most of them don't know CS. I really know him, so it's a lot different. Of course, what he showed with TSM or whatever wasn't that good. He has a bit of the same problem as mezii. He's okay to do everything. He's okay to be a bitch in some way and let the others shine, but he doesn't understand that he needs also things for himself. mezii is a bit the same. He has never created any problems in the team but he's not thinking enough about himself sometimes and doesn't want to make moves or whatever."", ""So for Jacky, I know him really well, I just try to use him the way he likes to play. And he's really fearless. He has a sick aim, I swear. His aim is really sick, the way he shoots, etc. Maybe sometimes, in some roles, he doesn't have the right understanding, because he played some different roles on T side, playing on the sides, etc., and not in the pack. So I'm trying to move him more now and trying sometimes to tell him to go and take his spot, etc., for him to shine."", ""Now you're going to play G2 in the semifinals. There's been a bit of back and forth between you guys. This year you win one match, they win one match... Last time, you lost to them at the Fall Final, also in the semi-finals. What are your expectations for this matchup?"", ""Well, I'm not going to lie, we should have won this game. We were 12-9 up. There is a round I pushed underground on Mirage, I remember, we know it's A, we lose the round. Bad stuff. They deserved the win because we couldn't finish a close game. So I think it's going to be a tough one for both teams. I don't know what's going to happen. It's always the same. They have sick individuals. We have sick individuals. It's also about who shows up on the day. Last time, NiKo showed up, malbs showed up, and we didn't show up that well. Except for ZywOo, maybe, and maybe flameZ."", ""But yeah, we need to have more players tomorrow to be good. I need to step up as well. And even though I told you the opposite, try to play without pressure. We just enjoy it here with JACKZ. I really enjoy playing with him. He's such a good guy, and he gives\u2026 While mezii is way calmer, this guy is way crazier, he creates a really good vibe in the team, and as a stand-in he just wants to do so well. After two-and-a-half years \u2014 I think his last stage was probably BLAST Spring in Lisbon \u2014 he really wants to show he's still capable.

Jo\u00e3o \""story\"" Vieira and Michel \""ewjerkz\"" Pinto were brought in as part of the overhaul, and would go on to be key pieces of the roster that made a fairytale run at IEM Cologne and earned Portugal their first national squad appearance at a Major two years later."", ""If SAW's RMR tale was one of a gut-wrenching failure turned into a silver lining, 9 Pandas' tale is the exact opposite, that of a delirious success that became a dark cloud."", ""Coming into PGL Major Copenhagen Europe RMR in 2024, nobody was talking about 9 Pandas. With CS legend Denis \""seized\"" Kostin at the helm, the Russian squad were amongst the middle of the pack of attendees when it came to world ranking, so grabbing a Major spot wasn't an outlandish thought. That No. 26 spot was padded by points from an unlikely PARI Please LAN victory late the previous year, however, which was a significant aberration in their general form."", ""9 Pandas' run in the main RMR event wasn't much to get excited about. A rousing 13-1 win over SAW was a highlight, but losses to FaZe, KOI and AMKAL, the latter two of which were lower-ranked than 9 Pandas, sent the Russians to the Last Chance Qualifier with little expectation upon them."", ""In the Last Chance Qualifier with the pressure ratcheted up a notch, 9 Pandas really kicked into gear. They began by handing out a devastating loss to the Danes of Astralis, a moment which might top a list of worst RMR moments. Astralis had thrown significant wads of cash at their persistent years of underperformances, and a squad featuring Benjamin \""blameF\"" Bremer, Nicolai \""device\"" Reedtz, Martin \""stavn\"" Lund and Jakob \""jabbi\"" Nygaard was left stuck in the mud by five Russians who were largely leftovers from their national scene. Danish pastries be damned, vodka reigns supreme."", ""A stiff test awaited 9 Pandas in the qualification bout, namely a GamerLegion side ranked inside the top 20 who had, albeit with a significantly different lineup, placed second at the previous Major. Not only did 9 Pandas win the series, but they did so in fairytale fashion, powered to a hard-fought victory by a life-game from then-30-year-old Aleksandr \""glowiing\"" Matsievich. The rifler, who only picked up CS in his late 20s, battered GamerLegion with a marauding and aggressive style of play that racked up highlight after highlight and headshot after headshot."", ""The scenes after 9 Pandas' qualification were the stuff of spine-tingling, hair-on-end dreams, tears flowing and harosh blyats flying. Not only did it mark the first Major for many of the players, an unlikely underdog tale coming true, but it also heralded the return of seized to Majors after a six-year absence."", ""This story did not have a happy ending. With the ecstatic haze of Major qualification behind them, 9 Pandas were struck by travel issues and could not make it to Denmark with their whole lineup. Thus, they were replaced at the Major. A torrid end to an otherwise inspiring tale."", ""Rarely do the best teams in the world miss the Major. Despite all the stress and pitfalls that come with the RMRs, the elite usually find a way to get through the tough times and ensure they appear at the most important event in CS. But not always."", ""IEM Road to Rio Europe RMR A was a momentous one as it marked the first time two juggernauts of the game would miss out on CS's marquee event. G2 and Astralis entered the RMR as the second and fourth-highest ranked teams in attendance, and were expected to qualify for the Major, and in the case of G2, breeze through."", ""Both squads faltered in BO1s and thus sported a 1-2 record heading into series play. One loss away from elimination, but surely these two giants would get their acts together now that proper, BO3 series were taking over? Instead, GamerLegion and FORZE took G2 and Astralis down respectively to relegate these giants of the game to the sidelines for the historic first Major in Brazil, and there were wider ramifications."", ""Astralis ditched Asger \""Farlig\"" Jensen and coach Martin \""trace\"" Heldt soon after the event, and not long into 2023 when the Danes brought back device only to miss out on the BLAST Paris Major as well, Andreas \""Xyp9x\"" H\u00f8jsleth and Lukas \""gla1ve\"" Rossander would be gone."", ""G2 would see coach R\u00e9my \""XTQZZZ\"" Quoniam depart as well, and arguably this failure in one of Rasmus \""HooXi\"" Nielsen's first events with the team would set the negative tone that accompanied him for much of his stint. Nikola \""NiKo\"" Kova\u010d said of the failure that he had \""never felt this empty and this much pain.\"""", ""G2 would bounce back from the disappointment, but for Astralis it marked the a major gut-punch in what would be an extended decline, and a string of further Majors missed, including Paris and then PGL Major Copenhagen in their home country. The RMRs could be a cruel mistress."", ""The hype for this roster was off the charts, at least in certain parts of the world. Imperial had made a blockbuster move in signing The Last Dance, a roster made up of the core of the two-time Major winning Brazilian squad that indelibly etched their names into CS history in 2016. They had already played at PGL Major Antwerp, but this was the big one: a Major in Brazil, IEM Rio 2022. Gabriel \""FalleN\"" Toledo was at the head of the squad, Fernando \""fer\"" Alvarenga was right by his side, and Lincoln \""fnx\"" Lau was on the sidelines as their coach."", ""After qualifying easily for Antwerp, things had gotten dicey for Imperial in this RMR; BO1 losses to 9z and their old teammate coldzera's 00NATION had left Imperial staring in the face of elimination. Series wins over TeamOne and Nouns kept the Brazilians alive, but left them still needing to navigate the 6-8th decider bracket against stiff opposition, namely paiN and Complexity."", ""Imperial battled to a 2-0 win over paiN, needing all 30 rounds on one map and OT on the other to secure victory. Still there was another test in their path in the form of the third-highest ranked team at the RMR, Complexity."", ""The series was one for the history books. The teams battled back and forth with huge plays being made on both sides of the server, all three maps were hotly-contested affairs, and the final map of Overpass came down to an overtime battle."", ""Marcelo \""chelo\"" Cespedes, a member of the squad that had not been a part of the dominant Brazilian teams of old, showed exactly why Imperial had chosen him to join the Last Dance as he had put up the bulk of the fragging needed to keep Overpass competitive, but as the map wore on, it was the old dogs who barked loudest."", ""FalleN came up with an important 1v2 to ensure his team garnered a winning T half, and the storied AWPer aced Complexity on the CT side with his sniper to help haul his team to OT. Ricardo \""boltz\"" Prass produced a vital 3k in overtime, whilst fer's experience ensured he kept a cool head and prevented Ricky \""floppy\"" Kemery from winning a match-defining 1v2 clutch."", ""It was everything Brazilian fans could have wanted. Their legends kept the Last Dance going for one more waltz around the block, qualified for a historic Major in their own country, and did so under the highest pressure in stunning fashion."", ""You can't do justice to a piece about the RMRs without mentioning Bad News Eagles. The fan-favorite Kosovan lineup repeatedly defied the odds without organizational support and transcended their usual level to march through three back-to-back RMRs in rip-roaring fashion."", ""If there is a single moment that defined Bad News Eagles at RMRs, it was their 2-0 victory over FaZe at BLAST.tv Paris Major Europe RMR A 2023. Qualification to the Major was directly on the line, and everyone expected FaZe to get through the series, if not easily. Instead, Bad News Eagles bested the European giants, overwhelming FaZe with their balls-to-the-wall style of gameplay."", ""The best part? Bad News Eagles thrived in the highest-pressure moments, the all-important clutches and man-disadvantage scenarios. They beat FaZe at their own game, and of course celebrated in typically exuberant fashion when they got the job done."", ""Of all the Danish squads who might have qualified for PGL Major Copenhagen, few would have predicted it would be ECSTATIC. Co-owned by streamer and skin fanatic zipeL, ECSTATIC were a team put together on a modest budget, made up of young Danish talents and cast-offs that were not wanted by the top national teams."", ""Where the likes of Astralis, who fielded the most-stacked Danish lineup, and Preasy, who sported five-time Major winner Peter \""dupreeh\"" Rasmussen, failed, the lower-ranked ECSTATIC succeeded, booking a spot at their home Major to ensure Denmark had at least one fully-national team to cheer for."", ""The MongolZ are now a staple of tier-one CS, regularly appearing at the biggest tournaments and giving the best in the business a run for their money. But, given their country's slim history in CS, where did this Mongolian powerhouse come from?"", ""It was the PGL Major Antwerp Asia RMR where Garidmagnai \""bLitz\"" Byambasuren, Sodbayar \""Techno\"" Munkhbold and coach Erdenedalai \""maaRaa\"" Bayanbat, playing as IHC, would announce themselves on the world stage. Ranked No. 78 at the time, IHC upset the apple cart by beating TYLOO and destroying Renegades to qualify for the Major, beginning the journey that would eventually see the core of the side become a top 10 team as The MongolZ."", ""9INE were not a team anyone was excited about heading into BLAST.tv Paris Major Europe RMR B. Ranked outside the top 30, the Polish squad, headlined by ex-ENCE man Olek \""hades\"" Miskiewicz, had previously been putting together solid if unspectacular results in tier-two online competitions, and came into the RMR as one of the lowest-ranked squads."", ""So of course they beat BIG, G2 and Vitality to storm to the Major in convincing fashion and become the first all-Polish squad at a Major since 2019. Not much became of 9INE afterwards, their squad was picked apart as they struggled to kick on, but their performance to make it to the Paris Major was one to be remembered."", ""IEM Fall 2021 wasn't quite the RMR as we know them now, but it was pretty much the same thing in practice. Instead of a singular qualification tournament, RMR used to stand for a point-based system where deep placements in select tournaments would qualify you for the Major. IEM Fall ended up being a de-facto qualification tournament, as due to disruption caused by COVID, it proffered the largest amount of RMR ranking points by far."", ""There was something in the water in Stockholm, Sweden during this tournament, as a fair few honourable mentions come from the event."", ""Ninjas in Pyjamas were hoping the recent blockbuster signing of device would usher in a new era for the organization and see them return to the trophy-winning heights of their famous Christopher \""GeT_RiGhT\"" Alesund and Patrik \""f0rest\"" Lindberg-powered lineup.
