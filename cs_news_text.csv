"siuhy: ""Sometimes we just forget to relax and regenerate""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39717/siuhy-sometimes-we-just-forget-to-relax-and-regenerate,"The Polish captain said MOUZ learned from their mistakes earlier in the year. After a successful end to the spring season with titles at BetBoom Dacha and ESL Pro League Season 19, MOUZ entered the break as one of the world's top teams. Their early form since returning is encouraging, too, as they placed in the top four at IEM Cologne and the Esports World Cup. Despite their successes, Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek says the team has worked hard to adjust their approach to avoid a similar burnout to the one they felt at IEM Dallas in May with the goal of hitting peak form just in time for the Shanghai Major. siuhy sat down with HLTV to discuss MOUZ's title chances in Belgrade, their expectations for the rest of the year, and Andreas ""Xyp9x"" Højsleth's integration into the team ahead of their BetBoom Dacha campaign. I wanted to start by talking about your season so far. You achieved a top-four at the Esports World Cup and a top-four at Cologne, so how are you feeling about those results? The season has been going really well. The only downside was IEM Dallas. I think that is one of the tournaments where we could have performed a lot better but, overall, it has been a really good season for us. I think we can all be proud of it. Now, the goals are a lot higher coming into the next season. We just want to do even better than last time. So far, since the break, you've only lost to Vitality and NAVI, playing them pretty close as well. What do you think you can do to get over that little hump? I think we have a very good base level at the minute, and we are able to compete against the best teams, but for us, I think it matters a lot if we step up on the day. When we do play against a top team like Vitality or NAVI, they will show you no mercy and they will capitalize on the mistakes you make. I think it's very important for us to be there on that day and show the best Counter-Strike we can. If we don't, the best teams in the world will just run you over, and I think that is something we need to work on. At IEM Cologne specifically, how good did it feel to get to a top-four finish at such a prestigious event? The narrative that people like to talk about is that you choke on stage, so how good did it feel to make a top-four? It felt really good, personally. Also for the team, and also for the organization. It's the first time MOUZ has ever won a stage game in Cologne, which is important for them, and I think it was an amazing feeling to do that. Especially also for the fans over there. The fans were amazing, we had our own MOUZ corner and they were great. It was a really great experience to play in front of them and to provide them with the experience that they missed out on in the last years. I'm really happy we were able to do that for them. I think semi-finals in Cologne is definitely not an easy task to do and we did that, but our goals were maybe a little bit higher than that. We were still happy with what we got, and I think it's a good start to the season and it sets us again on a good baseline for the next tournaments. Maybe even a line that we want to be higher above. So we are happy with that. torzsi made some comments recently that, at that tournament, you outplayed and outcalled G2. How does it feel to have that confidence from your teammates, that they really believe in you and your calling? It means a lot. Probably to any player, not only to me specifically. I'm sure that if any player feels that trust and that confidence coming from your teammates, especially, it will mean a lot to you. It just makes you a better player. Who doesn't like confidence, who doesn't like people giving you compliments, you know? Hearing this from your closest friends and teammates boosts you. It allows you to keep up that form. That's what torzsi did and I'm thankful to him. torzsi also played great in that game, so here's me... Passing it back? Exactly, I'm passing it back to him right now. So yeah, it feels great. Coming into this tournament, surely it's one MOUZ are looking to win? Yes, this is a tournament that we are coming into with high expectations for ourselves. At the same time, we also don't want to put pressure on ourselves to win it, but we know this is a good tournament for us to win again and build up a confidence streak similar to last season, when we won EPL and BetBoom. Winning it now, we are looking to create that form again and ride off of it for the rest of the season. Looking forward to the rest of the season, is the big goal just the Major and peaking for that? That is the goal for us. We had long talks before the start of the season. We talked about what we want to achieve this season and we highlighted the most important tournaments for us. We basically created a path on how to reach success and reach the peaks at each tournament. So that is what we are working on as a team, and obviously the most important are the Major, Cologne, all these tournaments, especially those with a crowd. We are on the right path to do that. When it comes to the Major, how important is it to manage your energy and manage those peaks? Maybe Dallas was one of those tournaments where you didn't manage your energy the right way. It's all about regeneration, especially in this team. We are a very young team and we like to have fun a lot of times. We like to do things, explore, and spend a lot of energy. Sometimes, we just forget to relax and regenerate when we know that an important tournament is coming up soon. That's what we are working on this season. We're working closely with our sports psychologists and coaches to make sure we have days when can do nothing, regenerate and relax, to have a fresh mindset coming into the next tournament. I think that's the most important for us because last season, we didn't really put a focus on it, and you could sense that coming into IEM Dallas. We lacked that regeneration. We didn't really know how to do it correctly and coming into Dallas we felt like we were a different team. Now, we're working on it from day one of this season, and to go into a Major it's going to be a very long journey. It's almost a month in China if you're there since the RMRs, so it's going to be very important that we reach our regeneration levels at the right time and reach our peak levels just before the tournament. Last question: You've been working with Xyp9x for a while now, what's that been like for the team? Something new for us, I've personally never had two coaches. Well, two 'coaches', because obviously I had an analyst before, but two coaches that you work closely with and the responsibilities are shared. So there are some things that you approach the assistant coach, which would be Xyp9x, and there are still some things that you approach sycrone with. It's good that we work on making it clear what responsibilities they have, so they are able to help us with one thing, and the other coach is helping us with a different thing. Our relationship in the team with everyone and Xyp9x has been really good so far, he's worked himself to join the team slowly. We didn't really rush him into having high responsibilities from the start. We wanted him to get to know the team and we didn't really want to change the dynamics instantly, we wanted to still be the MOUZ that we know we are, and we wanted him to just join us and make us better with what we already have. That's what he's doing at the minute, he's still slowly getting into the team, and still slowly learning new things. Obviously, it's a new role for him as well, there's still a lot of things for him to learn, but he's doing a really good job. I think he has helped us quite a bit so far, so I think it's going in the right direction with him.",28-8-2024 10:56,1724835360000
9 Pandas slam FURIA at BetBoom Dacha,https://www.hltv.org/news/39704/9-pandas-slam-furia-at-betboom-dacha,"The Russian team has avoided an early meeting with rivals Aurora and will instead face off against Eternal Fire for a spot in the playoffs. 9 Pandas rounded out the second day of the BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 Play-in with a statement 2-0 victory over FURIA to send the Brazilian side to the elimination zone. With the win, the Russian squad moved on in the Group B upper bracket to play against Eternal Fire in a match for a place in the Belgrade tournament's playoffs, set to take place on Monday at 18:00 . Meanwhile, FURIA will play for survival against Aurora, who lost to Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş and company earlier on the second day of the play-in stage. In a brief comment to HLTV following the match, Aleksandr ""shalfey"" Marenov said the achievement against FURIA was ""not a big win"" for the 9 Pandas, who the in-game leader thinks are being underrated at the moment. ""I feel that we are a very strong team, and not everyone right now understands that,"" he said. ""We have a lot of firepower and a lot of good stuff that we can bring to our game."" The 42nd-ranked team's Belgrade campaign began just two days after they also successfully traversed the Perfect World Shanghai Major Europe closed qualifier to secure a place at the RMR, despite a last-minute dramatic turn in their trade with Aurora nearly ending in them being unable to use their newest player, Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov. They started off the run in Serbia in more than convincing fashion against FURIA, winning Dust2 13-7 after r3salt led the way to a dominant T side finish, and Mirage 13-8 despite starting off the first half down 2-5.",25-8-2024 23:18,1724620680000
Short news: Week 34,https://www.hltv.org/news/39654/short-news-week-34,"The Esports World Cup seems poised to return in 2025, with an announcement on Twitter stating that the Riyadh-based tournament would be hosted in July and August next year. ESL had previously announced tournament dates for 2025 that feature a tournament running from August 20-24, a possible date for EWC's return. Playing Virtus.pro in their deciding Showdown match for a spot in the BLAST Premier Fall Final, Falcons were just about to lose their grip on map one. That was until Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García clutched the 1v4 in the 23rd round to avert the comeback: After first unveiling Samuel ""Zyppe"" Martinsson as their new coach, GODSENT have now announced their new all-Swedish Counter-Strike lineup. The team features three members from the organization's former academy team, Young Gods, and looks as follows: Charlie ""Cham"" Ahlm Leo ""Wonder"" Wänlund Frank ""Fraaank"" Issal Liam ""MaiL09"" Tügel Timmy ""Snow"" Bruhn Samuel ""Zyppe"" Martinsson (coach) The organization spared no words of praise when speaking about their talent, saying the team has an ability to ""become absolute world-class in a short time"" and calling 15-year-old MaiL09 a ""true god"" and ""likely the next Lionel Messi of Swedish CS."" On X, BLEED coach Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović admitted that he is unsure what the future will hold after his team failed to qualify for the Europe RMRs. BLEED were defeated by GamerLegion 2-0 in the final round of the Swiss stage. On Mirage, the second map of the series, they let a 12-3 lead slip before losing the game in overtime. ""Embarrassing, really,"" kassad wrote. ""Not sure what's next."" Amidst all the RMR chaos, paiN have eliminated Cloud9 from the BLAST Fall Showdown in a two-map series. Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt and company won Nuke 13-8 and then weathered a Cloud9 comeback, started by Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov's ace, to win Mirage 13-9. HLTV parent company's tournament organizer AR3NA.GG is hosting a Counter-Strike 2 league for companies all around Europe called COLLEAGUE, which will take place from September 26-December 15. The league's main goal is for colleagues to team up and have fun in a competitive system, but there's a big prize for the winning team too: An all-expenses paid trip to a PSG or FC Barcelona Champions League match. Anyone can sign up for a fee of €150 per company team by September 10. You can find out more on the official website. Citing an overlap with the announced dates of the PGL Shanghai Major RMRs, ESL has moved the scheduled date for ESL Challenger Katowice back nearly one month, from November 22-24 to October 25-27. BIG EQUIPA have announced the temporary addition of Martyna ""LETi"" Owsik, who will replace Alexandra ""kyossa"" Tykhonska in the starting lineup. LETi has been without a team since the start of the month, when NAVI Javelins decided to go international. BIG EQUIPA are now: Ana ""Zana"" Queiroz Jennifer ""JennyR"" Irina Brea Rodriguez Paulie ""pauliiee"" Barazani Julia ""juliano"" Kiran Martyna ""LETi"" Owsik (temporary) Alexandra ""kyossa"" Tykhonska (inactive) Jonathan ""MusambaN1"" Torrent (coach) Romanian tournament organizer PGL is close to acquiring Swedish matchmaking platform Esportal, according to a report from Dust2.se. This comes just weeks after the platform's company, Esportal Group, filed for bankruptcy. According to the same report, Swedish CS legend Tommy ""Potti"" Ingemarsson will take over Inferno Online, the company's famous LAN centers. Rounds have announced that they have dispensed with the services of Olli ""sLowi"" Pitkänen. On X, the Finnish organization explained that the team's association with the former HAVU player ""did not bring the desired results."" ""Together with Olli, the team decided it was time to move on,"" Rounds added. With the 28-year-old's departure, Rounds are now: Panu ""p12"" Schutschkoff Pekko ""p3kko"" Korkalainen Ville ""Villeboe"" Saarela Kosti ""Kollo"" Kallioniemi ""You can wallbang from back of B site to quad theoretically,"" the map designer added in reply to a question about whether the windows in Checkers are penetrable. Previously, he has shared images of Middle, A site, and B site. 9z will be without head coach Gustavo ""tge"" Motta for BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 as he will undergo surgery, Sebastián ""siag"" Ahumada, the organization's sporting director, revealed on X. The Brazilian coach will be back in time for ESL Pro League 20, which kicks off September 3, siag added. 9z will take on Falcons in the first round of the Play-In's Group A, which also includes paiN and BetBoom. On X, Ulrich ""theflyingdj"" Schulze, SVP of Game Ecosystems at the ESL FACEIT Group, clarified that the company has not yet made a decision regarding the use of Snap Tap and similar keyboard features in its tournaments. He also cited ""miscommunication"" in a statement issued to Dust2.us. ""Valve have released a detection method that is not available to everyone yet, so we are waiting for this to be the case before aligning our rules with it,"" he stressed. Schulze then added: ""We usually do not define rules when we are missing key information about how to enforce them across the tournaments they apply to (such as, for example, availability and reliability of the detection), which is why we are not doing that right now."" Valve has added a small update to CS2, introducing the ""Masterminds 2"" Music Kit Box to the game, featuring contributions from eight different artists. You can view the (very brief) patch notes here, and listen to snippets of the new Music Kits in the post here. Martin ""STYKO"" Styk has released a video showing how he consistently lands a popular Mirage jump-thrown smoke: ""Am I just lucky or those who are saying it's inconsistent are being skillgap'd?"" Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken has also released a few videos on Twitter from various maps and had a more nuanced take: ""Smokes that have room for error are going to be fine, but certain smokes that required a consistent movement are not going to always hit without a bind."" IHC have announced the addition of former Evil Geniuses and Copenhagen Flames coach Daniel ""Vorborg"" Vorborg as an analyst to aid the Mongolian team. Vorborg retired from coaching and co-founded esports agency UNCORE in July. The second IEM Rio Europe open qualifier kicked off on Sunday and only two rounds are left to play, with the best-of-one quarter-finals currently underway before the best-of-three qualifying round kicks off. A highlight match in the quarters has Cloud9 facing off against Ninjas in Pyjamas on Anubis, with ENCE notably missing out after a shameful loss to kONO, a Ukrainian team ranked No. 98 in the world. FAVBET have announced Max ""Marix"" Kugener as their new fifth, replacing Andrii ""guthriee"" Havrysh.

After securing a quarter-final finish at PGL Major Copenhagen, Eternal Fire has struggled to replicate their heroics from the all-important Danish event, dropping from 7th to 19th in the world rankings over the past four months, further compounded by a recent early exit from the IEM Cologne Play-in. As such, Engin ""MAJ3R"" Küpeli's troops are aiming for redemption at BetBoom Dacha Season 2, with the Turkish side already getting off on the right foot with an opening victory over Aurora. Shortly after his team's victory over Aurora, Eternal Fire AWPer Özgür ""woxic"" Eker spoke with HLTV regarding the match versus the Russian side, Eternal Fire's aspirations for the event, and how the team has dealt with their decline in form since the Copenhagen Major. Congratulations, what are you feeling after that series? At the start I was not feeling good, but in the end, when you are bouncing back and managing to come back to this kind of games, I feel happy. I wasn't personally ready for the first map, because I had a stomach issue and I came too late to the computer. So I had like one or two minutes to warm up, because we had to go and walk and after that we just started instantly. It's not an excuse, we should have won that first map as well if we did not do small mistakes in clutch situations, or in entering site situations. So yeah, I'm feeling happy about the result. So was it just small mistakes that threw the 10-5 lead on Mirage? Yeah just small mistakes, not understanding each other, little communication issues, these kind of things happened to us. Also aiming issues I personally had in the first map, kills I should get I didn't, which also affected the game. Maybe it also happened for the other guys, but I don't know from their perspective. I had to do my best to come back on the second and third map, I just kept my motivation and my mental. Is this a type of tournament that Eternal Fire aim to win? Yeah of course. First we need to qualify, and after that we should win this kind of event. Of course, maybe you cannot win a Major, Pro League, or these kinds of IEM tournaments, but this kind of tournament, it needs to be the main goal for us to go for first place. I think we can do it, if we just do what we did in the last two maps, if we just do this for all of the tournament, I think we can beat anybody. Eternal Fire had a big peak at the start of the year, you had a really good finish at the Major and hit your best HLTV ranking, but things have fallen off since then. What do you think has happened there? I think after the break our performance went down a bit. We were showing good Counter-Strike and we were feeling very nice inside of the team, but after that, the bad result after bad result, we lost our confidence a bit. We've just overall redone our tactics and playbook, everything we just switched up or changed. Small changes, if there's a smoke for example, we are changing the smoke so it won't land on that timing, these kinds of things. I think we are going to show our good side of Counter-Strike, like we did before, and I think we are not far away from that because we are working really hard at the moment. So I think we are going to get the prize in the end. Do you think, once you hit the peak at the Major, the motivation dropped off a bit after that? When there's a Major, it's like you are, personally and as a team, having a different kind of mindset. Mentally you just want to win that tournament, or do as much as you can, because it's a Major, it's a legendary event. In the other events when we fell off after that, like in India or in Abu Dhabi, even the TeamSpeak is not the same as when we were playing in the Major games. I think this is our minus side. If we improve that, we will not get these kind of results in this kind of tournament.",26-8-2024 00:16,1724624160000

Media: NiKo to join Falcons after Shanghai Major,https://www.hltv.org/news/39707/media-niko-to-join-falcons-after-shanghai-major,"Falcons are reportedly due to make their second attempt for NiKo stick after failing the first in late 2023. G2 superstar Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač is on course to joining Falcons after the ongoing season concludes at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, multiple reports suggest. French streamer and leaker Sebastien ""KRL"" Perez first said on Saturday that G2 and Falcons reached an agreement to transfer the Bosnian at the beginning of 2025 and that the deal only hinged on a signature from NiKo. A Sheep Esports report followed two days later with the information that the agreement was accepted on Monday and that the transfer is worth between $1 to $1.2 million. It also says that NiKo plans to accept a three-year contract with Falcons starting on January 1. This is the second time that Falcons are after NiKo. When the Saudi Arabian organization's ambitious new roster was being built at the end of 2023, the Bosnian was all but confirmed to join the likes of Emil ""Magisk"" Reif and Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer on the roster, until he decided to stay with G2 for the 2024 season in a last-minute U-turn. After failing to land the No. 2 player of 2023, Falcons have struggled to make good on the high ambitions they set after landing Magisk and Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen from Vitality in a bid to create a new Counter-Strike superpower. Their best result in 2024 remains a top-four finish at IEM Katowice from the beginning of the year, when Falcons still featured Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas on the roster. The Jordanian was replaced on the team by Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen just two months later in the aftermath of their failure to qualify for PGL CS2 Major Copenhagen, but the change has done little to improve their results. In their five months with the 31-year-old, Falcons failed to make it to the playoffs at three consecutive Big Events and only achieved modest success in smaller tournaments with a top-four finish at BetBoom Dacha Belgrade and second place at ESL Challenger Jönköping. Falcons are currently deep into their campaign at the second edition of BetBoom Dacha Belgrade, having just qualified for the playoffs. They're also playing for a spot at IEM Rio in the European closed qualifier, which runs concurrently with the event taking place in Serbia. G2 and Falcons declined to comment on the matter after being contacted by HLTV.",26-8-2024 12:49,1724669340000
Falcons get revenge on 9z to book BetBoom Dacha playoff spot,https://www.hltv.org/news/39708/falcons-get-revenge-on-9z-to-book-betboom-dacha-playoff-spot,"Snappi's troops put their experience to use in another elimination series as they brushed aside the South American side. Falcons have booked a spot in the main stage of BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 thanks to a 2-0 victory over 9z in Group A's consolidation final, exacting revenge for Saturday's 2-1 defeat in the opening round. It was a dominant display from Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's charges, who once again found a way to play their best game in an elimination series, like Emil ""Magisk"" Reif had suggested. They came back from 7-2 down on Dust2 and then hammered 9z on their own map pick, where they posted a flawless CT half. ""Tired of losing,"" Falcons coach Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen said after the series. ""We need to get the grind up. When you're losing, you have to play more. That's how it is. The guys are putting in a lot of work and we're professional. We're tired of losing and we really want to get more Ws."" 9z will be disappointed with the way their Belgrade campaign came to an end. They started the match brightly and looked comfortable on Falcons' map pick of Dust2. But a blunder from Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez late in the first half seemed to breathe life into the European team. Falcons ended the half down by just two rounds, and they quickly dispatched their opponents in the second half, ending the game on an 11-2 run. Carrying their momentum into Mirage, Falcons went 12-0 on the CT side before putting the series to bed just two rounds into the second half. 9z will now have a few days to lick their wounds and process this latest European defeat before returning to action in ESL Pro League 20. As for Falcons, they will take on paiN on Tuesday in Group A's final before entering the playoffs, where they will join the Brazilian side, MOUZ, Spirit, Virtus.pro, HEROIC and two more teams.",26-8-2024 13:03,1724670180000

Open qualifiers on the road to the Shanghai Major in East Asia and Rest of Asia have concluded with five teams passing through to the closed stage in the former sub-region and six teams in the latter. Among those who made it in Rest of Asia are Alter Ego featuring some well-known names from the region, including former TYLOO duo Hansel ""BnTeT"" Ferdinand and WingHei ""Freeman"" Cheung and ex-MVP PK star Hyun-Pyo ""XigN"" Lee. The mixed roster won the open qualifier and joined invited sides True Rippers and Gods Reign and five other qualified teams in the closed qualifier, where they'll fight it out for an Asia RMR spot from August 28-30. Rest of Asia closed qualifier (August 28-30) In East Asia, three East Russian and two Mongolian sides traversed the open qualifier to join Chinggis Warriors, ATOX and GR in the closed qualifier, which will also be played from August 28-30. In a rather absurd turn of events, Glamour made it to the closed qualifier despite the fact that they were forced to forfeit their quarter-final matchup at the beginning of the second day due to one of their players being asleep. The Russian side ended up winning the fifth-place decider bracket with two consecutive victories just a few hours later. East Asia closed qualifier (August 28-30) The two qualifiers were the last of a series of seven open tournaments which fed teams into the five Asian sub-regions' closed qualifiers along with the Valve Regional Standings. Previously the Chinese, Middle Eastern, and Oceanic closed qualifiers had their full team lists completed. Each of these will also qualify one team for the Asia RMR, which will take place in Shanghai, China from November 11-14 and offer three spots at the Perfect World Shanghai Major.

"SunPayus: ""I haven't been performing, but it's a matter of time""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39709/sunpayus-i-havent-been-performing-but-its-a-matter-of-time,"Despite his and his team's recent improvements, SunPayus expects more. Falcons have enjoyed a mini-resurgence in recent weeks, playing solid Counter-Strike at IEM Cologne before qualifying for BLAST Fall Final thanks to a near-flawless run through Showdown. The European combine continued this uptick in form in Belgrade by qualifying for the main event at BetBoom Dacha Season 2, taking down BetBoom before emphatically dusting off 9z, avenging a loss to the South Americans earlier in the competition. Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García sat down with HLTV after securing a spot alongside MOUZ and Spirit in the BB Dacha main event to give an interview, and he spoke about his team's recent improvements, his own form, and the team's expectations for the rest of the tournament. Congratulations, you've made it through to the main event. How are you guys feeling? We are feeling really good. We are playing so many officials these days, since we came to Serbia, so I think we are just getting better and better, and getting used to making fewer mistakes. So yeah, we are pretty happy. Speaking about this game specifically: 9z beat you earlier in the event, what allowed you to turn it around and get a different result this time? They beat us because I think they played great on the third map, on Nuke. They played a really good T side, but we didn't actually convert some CT rounds that we had an advantage in, so, in the end, it was a really close match. We knew it was our first official here and we didn't play well. After we got some officials rolling and we fixed some mistakes from that match, we just improved quite a lot from that day to today. Specifically on Mirage they beat you 13-5 the first time around, and it was a complete change of result today. Do you think it was to do with playing more officials, or did you play any differently? Yeah, we actually had… not a long talk, but a mini-talk, about 10 minutes, about how our CT defaults would look, how we should move around the map. So we put some new agreements in place so we are more dynamic on the map, and that's why I think we played much better. Yesterday we also played another tournament, against VP, and we played much better also against them. We are good on CT-side Mirage now (laughs). Like you said, you have been playing a lot of officials at the moment. How has it been for you? Obviously, a little bit tiring, but it looks like you are improving. I think it's good just because we want to get as ready as possible for the Shanghai Major. We were practicing a lot and we were playing okay, but all of a sudden in officials we were not playing as well, so zonic and Snappi decided to play more, so we came here and we have also these online tournaments. Yeah, I think it's really tiring but also nice, because I can see the development from the team pretty fast. I spoke to Magisk yesterday and I asked him about the team, because you guys are improving and it feels like you're on the right track at the moment, but your personal form also seems to have picked up since the start of Falcons. How are you feeling right now? Well right now I don't think I'm on a good level, the team is getting better and as the team gets better I will also play better. Obviously I know what I'm capable of, and it also happened to me when I joined ENCE, for the first six months I didn't perform. Right now, these six months, I haven't been performing, but I know myself and it's a matter of time. I just need to keep smiling, keep my good attitude, and keep moving on. Watching from the outside it feels like you are picking the rifle up a little bit more. Is that a conscious decision, or how has that come about? Well, I like to play rifle, too, I think every AWPer is also really good with a rifle. It's not a decision, but if we start a match, we are 4-0, I am feeling the rifle and we are having good economy… if I feel like we don't need to pull out the AWP because it's not needed yet, then I don't pick it up. It also depends on the map, I might need to take the AWP out much more. Is this a tournament Falcons are looking to win, or go deep in? Right now I don't think we have really high expectations. There are really good teams in the next stage, and our main goal is to get ready as much as we can for the Major, so we are taking these officials as practice. Our goal is just to keep playing officials.",26-8-2024 15:25,1724678700000
Sources: PARIVISION's RMR disqualification overturned after appeal**,https://www.hltv.org/news/39711/sources-parivisions-rmr-disqualification-overturned-after-appeal,"F_1N appealed his ban with ESIC months ago, but the esports watchdog failed to share its decision with Valve at the time, sources tell HLTV. Update 03:15 : In a statement to HLTV, ESIC denied that they directly reduced F_1N's ban, but that an ""Independent Appeal Panel (independent of ESIC) has recently both accepted and made a decision with respect to a significantly out of time appeal by F_1N and communicated the same to Valve."" The decision is expected to be published on ESIC's website within 24 hours. ESIC added: ""It seems that Perfect World was not aware of F_1N’s appeal to ESIC’s independent appeal panel when making their decision to disqualify the team “PARIVISION”. Perfect World has recently reached out to ESIC to confirm the details of the appeal and the decision made."" HLTV's sources however say F_1N's demerit points were updated after his appeal months prior and that the decision was not communicated to Valve nor Perfect World until recent events. Update 22:04 : Monte's assistant coach, Piotr ""nawrot"" Nawrocki, has confirmed on X that a tournament admin informed teams that there will be no last-chance qualifier. PARIVISION will be allowed to compete at the Perfect World Shanghai Major Europe RMR after successfully arguing its case with organizers, multiple sources with knowledge of the situation tell HLTV. The Russian team was disqualified from the competition due to having a Valve-banned individual, coach Ivan ""F_1N"" Kochugov, present during their closed qualifier campaign. The 40-year-old and accompanying staff surrounded the team in a now-deleted celebratory video after PARIVISION beat GamerLegion in their 2-1 qualifying match. F_1N was among over 30 coaches banned by the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) in 2020 for using the infamous coaching bug. He was found to have used it in six official matches for 34 rounds, resulting in a nine-month ban from ESIC member events and a permanent ban from Valve Majors based on his total demerit points. However, sources tell HLTV that the Russian coach successfully appealed his ban with ESIC's independent appeal panel and had his demerit points reduced earlier this year, and that the esports watchdog did not announce or share its decision with external parties until after PARIVISION's disqualification took place. With a reduction in demerit points, F_1N would fall below the six-point cut-off for a permanent suspension by Valve and be allowed to return to Majors, which now appears to be the reality after Valve were reportedly made aware of ESIC's decision. As a result, the two last-chance qualifier matches that were scheduled to determine a replacement for PARIVISION are expected to be canceled, leaving KOI, Monte, and BLEED out of Major contention once again.",26-8-2024 21:12,1724699520000
Eternal Fire through to BB Dacha playoffs; Aurora eliminated,https://www.hltv.org/news/39712/eternal-fire-through-to-bb-dacha-playoffs-aurora-eliminated,"Just one more group-stage spot remains up for grabs. Eternal Fire are through to the main stage of BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 following a 2-0 win over 9 Pandas in the Group B upper-bracket final. Earlier in the day, Aurora were eliminated by FURIA, who now have one more chance to make it to the group stage tomorrow. The Turkish side joins paiN and Falcons in qualifying for the group stage, where Spirit, MOUZ, Virtus.pro, and HEROIC await the four Play-in teams. Just one more spot remains up for grabs, and it is set to be decided between 9 Pandas and FURIA. The teams already met in the upper-bracket semi-final, where 9 Pandas were able to get the better of the Brazilians, sparking a war of words between Aleksandr ""shalfey"" Marenov and Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo. Their rematch will happen on Tuesday at 14:30 . Eternal Fire met 9 Pandas in a late-night match due to the Turkish side previously playing in the Europe IEM Rio qualifier, where they progressed to the upper-bracket final after 2-0 wins against B8 and Cloud9. Eternal Fire's game against 9 Pandas was equally straightforward, with two dominant CT sides on Nuke (9-3) and Anubis (10-2) paving their way to the BB Dacha group stage. The Turkish side's play-in campaign isn't done after the victory, though, as they will face off against the winner of FURIA vs. 9 Pandas for seeding purposes and $10,000. Before the qualification bout, the Group B action began with an elimination clash between teams in dire form. Aurora came into the game by winning one out of their last eight matches, while FURIA won one out of five. The series began on Mirage, where FURIA couldn't handle Denis ""deko"" Zhukov's AWP, as the sniper racked up a 1.70 rating on the map. His team wasn't able to hold on to the lead, however, allowing FURIA to put together a nine-round Inferno T side to tie up the score. The Nuke decider was another close-fought affair, but FURIA's offensive half was once again enough for the FalleN-led squad to stay alive in Belgrade after a 13-9 victory.",27-8-2024 00:17,1724710620000
"RED Canids, Fluxo, Legacy facing elimination after first day of Americas RMR qualifiers",https://www.hltv.org/news/39713/red-canids-fluxo-legacy-facing-elimination-after-first-day-of-americas-rmr-qualifiers,"Eight teams are already out of Shanghai Major contention across the two Americas qualifiers. The first day of closed qualifiers for the Americas RMR has reached its end with eight teams eliminated across North and South America. The brutal format of the qualifiers, which use a Swiss system to determine four out of 16 teams who advance, means that teams are eliminated after just two losses rather than three. Two teams advance from the 3-0 pool and two from the 3-1 pool, with a fourth-place decider played between the 3-1 teams with the lower Bucholz scores for the final spot. This resulted in some early strife for the three highest-ranked teams in the South America qualifier — ODDIK, RED Canids, and Fluxo — as they were narrowly upset in their opening best-of-one games and cast down to the 0-1 pool. All three stabilized in series play, with Fluxo bagging a convincing 2-0, ODDIK winning two one-sided maps in a reverse-sweep, and Marcelo ""coldzera"" David's side coming closest to an early exit and only barely scraping past Intense 2-1. Two qualification matches and four elimination matches will take place on day two of the SA qualifier, with the matchups looking as follows: 2-0 advancement pool 1-1 elimination pool The first two rounds of the NA qualifier played out much as expected, although NRG faced some early trouble from Akimbo in a 13-10 win before easing past Elevate to make the 2-0 pool. BOSS was awarded a forfeit win in their opening round after a player from Take Flyte was stuck in traffic and couldn't arrive in time for the match, and converted that into a 2-0 record after edging past Gabriel ""NEKIZ"" Schenato's Legacy 13-10 on Anubis, casting the Brazilian team down to the 1-1 elimination pool. The matchups for day two of the NA qualifier are: 2-0 advancement pool 1-1 elimination pool",27-8-2024 07:00,1724734800000
Official: PARIVISION's RMR disqualification overturned,https://www.hltv.org/news/39714/official-parivisions-rmr-disqualification-overturned,"Tournament organizer Perfect World cite a ""newly communicated ESIC appeal process"" that meant F_1N was allowed to be around the PARIVISION squad. PARIVISION will compete at the Shanghai Major EU RMR after their disqualification was overturned by Perfect World, confirming a report by HLTV. The decision means the EU Last Chance Qualifier, scheduled for August 27 featuring the three 2-3 teams KOI, Monte, and BLEED, is no longer required and has been cancelled. PARIVISION were initially barred from flying to Shanghai by Perfect World after posting celebrations on social media that showed coach Ivan ""F_1N"" Kochugov, then believed to be serving a permanent ban from Valve events, present with the team. F_1N was one of 37 coaches suspended in 2020 for using the infamous coach bug in six official matches for 34 rounds. That was enough to earn a permanent ban from Valve, while the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) barred him from their member events for nearly nine months. His ban has now been cut short after what ESIC called a ""special evaluation of the significantly out-of-time appeal."" The appeal, posted four years after the sentence was handed out, proved successful after a review by ESIC's Independent Appeal Chair ""based on the appeal’s merits and the compelling evidence provided by him."" ""This change has been communicated to and accepted by Valve."" This process was not made public until today, but F_1N's status was not communicated to Perfect World immediately upon its conclusion. Upon receiving this information, the TO overturned PARIVISION's ban and re-instated their place at the EU RMR. Valve's Major rulebook, section Stage Integrity, sub-section Team staff restrictions says: ""In the case of any matches where event admins are not physically present (e.g. online matches), no team staff, including the coach, may be physically or virtually present or communicate with the players at any time during the match."" Having any staff other than players present in the room during online matches is still against the rules, according to the excerpt from Valve's Major rulebook above. This alone, however, was not the reason behind the original decision to bar PARIVISION from participating in the RMR, with Perfect World focussed on F_1N's status as a banned individual. HLTV has reached out to ESIC to inquire about when the appeal process was completed and when it was communicated to Valve, but did not receive a response at the time of the article's release.",27-8-2024 11:20,1724750400000

PGL has announced details for eleven tier-one events around the globe over the next two years, including annual events in Astana, Kazakhstan and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The circuit will also see the Romanian tournament organizer host events in Bucharest, Belgrade, and — in 2026 — São Paulo and Barcelona. The capacity for more is also present, with PGL pledging ""other surprises"" in addition to these 11 initial events. See the full calendar for the next twelve months at hltv.org/calendar The operator has hosted no standalone events in recent years, with calendar space restricted by the semi-franchised ESL and BLAST circuits, but hosted three Valve Majors (Stockholm, Antwerp, and Copenhagen) and is partnered with Perfect World for the CS Asia Championships and a fourth Major in Shanghai this November. With Valve removing direct team-to-TO partnerships from 2025 onwards, PGL are re-entering the space aggressively with a minimum of eleven events in the next two years. Six will be run by PGL on their own, in addition to four events in partnership with FiReSPORTS and a continuation of their Perfect World partnership with CS Asia Championships 2025. ""PGL is pleased to announce that the CS2 competitive landscape has evolved, embracing a more open and inclusive approach,"" the TO said in a press release. ""This change marks a pivotal moment in esports, democratizing event organization and fostering a more vibrant and diverse competitive scene."" Each 16-team event will have a Major-matching prize pool of $1.25 million, and a budget of $450,000 for hospitality purposes including tickets, accommodation for 8 people, food, and six-person practice rooms for each invited team. They will also function as 'Ranked' events in line with Valve's new rulebook. Invites for the events will be handed out directly based on the global Valve Regional Standings (VRS), with no open qualifiers because of the ""very busy event schedule."" If a roster declines the invite, or cannot secure visas in time, it will be extended to the next roster in the VRS until all slots are filled. The exception to the global invite system will be the three South American events, where the top two teams from the home region will be invited in addition to 14 intercontinental invites. All events will sport a best-of-three Swiss system group stage and eight-team single elimination playoff brackets with a best-of-five grand final.

FURIA have claimed the final spot in the BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 playoffs after securing a 2-0 win over 9 Pandas at the end of the play-in stage. In the rematch from the opening round, where 9 Pandas had battered FURIA on two maps, the Brazilians responded in kind as Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo delivered on some fighting words he had brought to the game. In a reply to Aleksandr ""shalfey"" Marenov's claim that 9 Pandas' opening triumph against FURIA was ""not a big win,"" the veteran AWPer said to Esports.gg that he was looking forward to the rematch because 9 Pandas were ""not that good."" FalleN went on to dominate the Russian side with a scoreboard-topping 46-22 K-D performance (1.65 rating). Inferno was a straightforward affair with FURIA putting on a 10-round CT side, while on Dust2 the Brazilians fought off a 9 Pandas comeback from 6-12 to secure the game in overtime.

G2 recover from map one defeat to smash FaZe,https://www.hltv.org/news/39494/g2-recover-from-map-one-defeat-to-smash-faze,"A G2 risk to ban Inferno and leave Mirage in the pool paid off in a 13-6 decider. The new G2 has continued its strong form by toppling FaZe 2-1 and securing a spot in Group C's final, putting them one series from Fall Final. That was despite dropping Ancient 13-9, G2's pick and the map Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and company had a six-map winning streak on. By the time we moved to Nuke, however, G2's individuals had warmed up and the result was utter domination. It was a statement series for the under-pressure Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, who ended top of the board with a 1.33 rating. He now has a 1.26 rating for the event, his best average since the Copenhagen RMR and far above his 1.04 CS2 average. ""Since CS2 I'm really playing a lot, that's not an issue,""  huNter- said post-match. ""When you make some changes, you want to show them that you're the player that everyone remembers and be a good example to the other players. As long as we are winning I don't care about my own performance."" Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa was the key man on Nuke, despite having four negative ratings in a row on the map for G2 and M80 as the Ramp anchor and Lobby lurker beforehand. The Guetamalan took over proceedings after a quad-kill on the MP9 in a confidence-filled display as he continues to prove both his talent and his versatility. He ended the half 17-3, and shone as the sides switched too with a sensational Deagle double-entry into Ramp — the second fully blind, and requiring an inch-perfect 90 degree snap. Map three was Mirage, G2's permaban under Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen, and eyebrows were raised on the desk after G2 chose Mirage over their usual pick of Inferno. ""We are practicing Mirage a lot and we are comfortable there,"" NiKo had said pre-game. ""We haven't played it much as well, so it's good to have Mirage officials under our belt."" If it was intended as practice in a non-elimination match at a fairly low-stakes event, Mirage could not have gone better for G2 as they sat FaZe down by rushing to a 9-0 lead with eight rounds in a row that denied a bomb plant, and 13-6 win. It does not mean, however, that G2 are turning away from Inferno, according to NiKo: ""Inferno has been our best map, one of our best ever since I joined G2. Snax kind of has to get used to it, it's stupid not to play it when we're already really good at it."" FaZe now drop to the lower bracket against one of Cloud9 or Ninjas in Pyjamas as they look to combat their slide down the rankings. Only David ""frozen"" Čerňanský put up any significant resistance on Nuke and Mirage, and after a poor Esports World Cup by their standards the FaZe team have a fight on their hands to return to the level required by their lofty standards. A rematch against G2 is still possible, in a match that will decide which Group C team qualifies for Fall Final early.",1-8-2024 15:09,1722517740000

HooXi benched in G2,https://www.hltv.org/news/39328/hooxi-benched-in-g2,"The in-game leader follows nexa to the chopping block as G2 look to shake things up further in this off-season. Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen has been removed from G2's starting roster, the organization announced in a farewell video on Monday. The in-game leader's removal is the second change in the G2 camp in the summer off-season. The organization replaced Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković with former M80 up-and-comer Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa on Friday. HooXi's replacement is not yet known. It is however likely finalized given that the roster submission deadline for the upcoming Esports World Cup, where G2 are slated to play, is today (Monday, July 1). HooXi joined G2 in the summer of 2022 from Copenhagen Flames. His two-year tenure got off to a poor start as the team failed to qualify for the IEM Rio Major, but the Dane went on to lead the organization to its first Big Event trophy since 2017 at the BLAST Premier World Final just two months later. That victory kickstarted a brief run of dominance which saw G2 go on a streak of 13 consecutive Big Event match wins and claim the title at IEM Katowice in the process. In the second half of 2023, G2 also lifted another highly-coveted trophy at IEM Cologne. But while they made nearly every playoffs, titles eluded HooXi following the triumph in Germany last August. G2's only victory came at IEM Dallas this May while Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip was playing instead of HooXi, which came as a further indictment on the already heavily scrutinized in-game leader. Exchanging Justin ""jks"" Savage for nexa at the brink of the year did little to change their fortunes, the Serbian was shown the exit door just six months later to make space for malbsMd, and HooXi now follows to the chopping block. The only question that remains is who will come in to replace the Dane. Is it going to be another in-game leader, or will G2 give the reins to Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač following his success as the temporary captain in Dallas? After the series of changes, G2 are down one man: Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas (coach) Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković (benched) Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen (benched)",1-7-2024 18:01,1719849660000

The trio joins Valdemar ""valde"" Bjørn Vangså, Rasmus ""Zyphon"" Nordfoss, and coach Allan ""Rejin"" Petersen on the team, who are now the only remnants of their previous European project. The move marks a return to their roots for TSM, who entered Counter-Strike in 2015 by signing a Danish team that eventually joined Astralis. acoR signs for the squad as the primary AWPer from GamerLegion, who he played for since September 2022 before getting removed after the Copenhagen Major. He played a key role in GamerLegion's run to the final at the BLAST Paris Major and helped the organization break into the top 10 of the world rankings in the process. Altekz comes into the team as a free agent after his latest team, Preasy, ceased operations in April. The 20-year-old is most known for his stint in the main Astralis team during 2023, when he helped the team reach the IEM Dallas playoffs while averaging a 0.98 rating across his tenure.

Editorial: Best and worst transfers of CS2,https://www.hltv.org/news/39321/editorial-best-and-worst-transfers-of-cs2,"HLTV's writers share their opinions on who made the best and worst transfers so far in CS2. As we approach the first full year of CS2, which was released after the summer of 2023, we wonder what the best and worst roster changes have been during the early era of the game post-CS:GO. Initially, the idea was to look back on the winter market, but with the advent of CS2 many teams jumped the gun and started to form their rosters in late summer and early fall, so we expanded the window to include all of the changes that came about with the seismic shift around the time the game was released. From Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov joining Spirit to Ninjas in Pyjamas's overhaul, or Astralis' no-anchor mayhem and G2's unpopular removal of Justin ""jks"" Savage, our staff give their opinions to see if there is a quorum on the best and worst transfers affecting the first half of 2024. sh1ro's decision to step down from Cloud9 came out of left field and was heavily scrutinized considering the roster he was leaving. There's no denying now that teaming up with Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets was a slam dunk of a move, and when you look at the ruin that is now Cloud9 perhaps we were too blind to see then that sh1ro was jumping a sinking boat. Singling out Emil ""Magisk"" Reif in the whole Falcons ordeal might seem harsh when the former ENCE core also came out much worse for it. However, the Dane was the first to commit to Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen and was leaving Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut behind and a Vitality team that went on to win a couple of events despite the downgrade. Who knows how this could have turned out had Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač not made the last-minute U-turn, and perhaps the promise of the Bosnian superstar may have swayed many of the incoming players, but the reality is Falcons have been nothing short of a disaster post-Katowice. - Milan ""Striker"" Svejda Ninjas in Pyjamas' RMR was a disaster. But it also offered the new management an opportunity to mold the team in their image. Björn ""THREAT"" Pers and Richard ""Xizt"" Landström came in, were trusted with sporting matters, and improvement came overnight. After a baffling amount of time was spent trying to make Fredrik ""REZ"" Sterner, Kristian ""k0nfig"" Wienecke, and Ludvig ""Brollan"" Brolin co-exist in the same team, the new team plucked anchor Isak ""isak"" Fahlén out of GamerLegion — a huge coup — and promoted the impressive Max ""maxster"" Jansson to (accidentally, they say) restore a Swedish core. But the big one is adding Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz. Daniil ""headtr1ck"" Valitov was a touch passive, but it's not like there was zero potential. You could have kept him. Instead, they boldly moved for the opposite style of sniper, compatriots though they are. At YaLLa Compass, we saw why r1nkle may very well end up as one of the three best rookies of 2024. Anyone who watched even a single map of Astralis and HEROIC in 2023 could have told you that making Martin ""stavn"" Lund and Benjamin ""blameF"" Bremer co-exist would be difficult. Playing exactly the same CT positions (and both wanting to be the trader on T) is one thing, but the clash in how they saw the game was even more stark. stavn is all about team-based proactivity and his ability to mid-round. blameF, as good as his raw numbers are, is about setting his own individual plays up. Adding Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard simultaneously only made things worse. Astralis removed Christian ""Buzz"" Andersen and Johannes ""b0RUP"" Borup, the two anchors in the old team, and added rotator jabbi and shifted poor old Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr — who was their best role-adjusted player in this period — to the graveyard shift of B on Mirage. Under blameF, stavn had a 0.99 T rating, and 1.08 on CT. jabbi, meanwhile, had 0.98 in his new anchor roles. Since the RMR, and blameF's departure, stavn has a 1.29 on CT and 1.12 on T. jabbi has a 1.13 on CT, and 1.19 on T. Roles matter. - Harry ""NER0"" Richards Spirit's management could hardly believe their luck when they learned that sh1ro had been made available for transfer by Cloud9. This wasn't a cheap move (rumors suggest that the deal cost upwards of $1 million), but it instantly allowed Spirit to solve one of their biggest issues while giving donk a reliable right-hand man. With Spirit, sh1ro has rediscovered his joy of playing and his best form, playing a key role during the team's title-winning campaigns in Katowice and London. With a 1.22 average rating and four EVPs, he is firmly in the conversation for Best AWPer of 2024. Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller is becoming a great example of how quickly things can change in modern Counter-Strike. Just months after making his first-ever appearance in the HLTV Top 20 Players of the Year, the Danish AWPer/IGL finds himself in an extremely fragile situation after a barren spell with Liquid. The fault lies squarely between the player and the organization, as the team never fully bought into the Dane's system, which raises serious questions about the thought process that went into creating the lineup. After half a season, the two brains of the project, cadiaN and Wilton ""zews"" Prado, are gone, and another player is believed to be on his way out. This is certainly not what cadiaN had in mind when he signed with Liquid at the end of last year. His stock has taken a precipitous fall, to the point where he might have a hard time finding a top team, and he may be left with no choice but to sit out the rest of the season. - Luís ""MIRAA"" Mira Losing David ""frozen"" Čerňanský was inevitable for MOUZ, and replacing a player like the Slovakian seemed impossible due to his fragging output. They passed the test with flying colors, though, as they found a worthy replacement in Brollan. The Swede's career was seemingly waning before MOUZ became the team to finally unlock his potential, something that both fnatic and Ninjas in Pyjamas failed to do. Because he is a different type of player and didn't take frozen's roles, his addition also helped his teammates reach a higher level, which allowed MOUZ to become one of the world's top teams despite losing their star player. A team short of firepower due to NiKo's and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač's struggles in CS2 removed a high-fragging anchor for a much more supportive one, and that alone is enough to make the move a bad one. When you add how G2 handled the communication and that the community seemed unanimous in branding the change a downgrade, which added so much pressure to the team, it's safe to say Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković's addition didn't have the desired effect. His removal in the summer break also tells its own story. - Žan ""Sumljiv"" Zupanič If there were any commensurate roster-building moment in CS2 that parallels 2012's legendary Ninjas in Pyjamas roster, then sh1ro joining Spirit would be the one. This change-out created titanic headwinds in CS2 and catapulted a five-man core into a permanent Top 5 fixture. sh1ro added the perfect amount of firepower, impact, and cohesion to Spirit’s roster, and has been the Patrik ""f0rest"" Lindberg to donk’s Christopher ""GeT_RiGhT"" Alesund (in terms of 2012 and 2013 days). This roster move also freed up Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia, allowing him to play a more specialized role and paid dividends to Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov’s overall leadership system. But most of all, since we love storylines at HLTV, it was the ultimate emotional payoff from the days of sh1ro looking like the poster child for depression during his time at Cloud9 to the new days of winning events. Three cheers for the Russian anime team. There are a couple good contenders here: cadiaN joining Liquid, Lukas ""gla1ve"" Rossander to ENCE (despite early promise), and the entire Falcons project. But nothing quite has the morbid and corrosive sting as nexa’s stint on G2 in hindsight. The obsession with nexa’s lack of impact on this roster reached fever pitch by the mid-half of 2024 prior to his benching. In Dante’s Inferno, the eighth circle of Hell is known as the Malebolge (“evil pouches”); in the first pouch, Dante is shown a gathering of frauds running to and fro while being scourged by whips amidst hellfire. If there ever were a space for a Pouch 1.5 to be created for our modern de_inferno, then surely it would be for nexa's pit position play on CT-side and how he was continuously scorched there. At the very least that is how many will remember his stint on G2. - Michal ""stich"" Malachowski After the heavyweight signings of jabbi and stavn failed to net results for Astralis, culminating in arguably the organization’s most embarrassing result in missing out on the PGL Copenhagen Major, the decision to part ways with blameF and bring on Alexander ""br0"" Bro was exactly the move the team needed. Taking on the supportive roles that the team sorely needed to be filled, br0’s addition has helped breathe new life into Astralis, who snagged four consecutive semi-finals in his first events with the team. One will be hard-pressed to find a bigger waste of time this season than the addition of storied in-game leader gla1ve to ENCE. He initially joined a lineup with one foot in the grave at the end of 2023, and matters were made only more bizarre by the Danish captain being tasked to lead four Poles ahead of the new year. A stunning quarter-final finish at IEM Katowice exceeded expectations for the skipper’s new side, but the remainder of ENCE’s season provided almost nothing to be excited about. If one believes that gla1ve’s prime is far behind him, it stings to see an organization like ENCE, which previously commanded competitive lineups, place him as the centerpiece of their roster. For those who believe that the Dane still has more to give, seeing him thrust into a season surrounded by players signed at the last minute makes the first half of gla1ve’s 2024 feel like a waste of time for nearly everybody involved. - Samuel ""Draik"" Popkes The MongolZ put themselves on the map in 2023 with a handful of upsets at Big Events, notoriously playing spoiler to FURIA in the Play-ins of IEM Katowice and IEM Cologne in what looked like a tale as old as time: An emerging roster from Asia attends a few top events and surprises higher-ranked teams, but fails to convert that into a deeper run and drops back into the depths of their region, not to be seen again until their next upset win or two in a handful of months. It was apparent quite early on that this was something different, though. The type of Counter-Strike The MongolZ played wasn't a gimmick, nor had off-meta strategies that surprised and allowed for ""fluke"" wins. The team had the structure and was working on playing ""proper"" Counter-Strike, but lacked the experience and firepower to contend against the best. Enter Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar. The 17-year-old previously played for The MongolZ in 2022, under a different lineup, and his return to the organization under Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren's leadership came upon the eve of the transition to CS2. Senzu has firmly established himself as the team's best player since joining, and the change has paid dividends as The MongolZ enjoyed breakout success in the first six months of 2024 making the Major's Elimination Stage, EPL playoffs, and two smaller titles to reach a high of 11th in the world rankings. The disaster-class of Falcons is a disappointing tale from a wealth of angles, including the ripping apart of a successful ENCE roster, but the impact it's had upon Magisk and his 2024 career is in a league of its own. Admittedly, the Dane may have joined with the expectation of the organization completing the blockbuster signing of NiKo or other superstar talent. However, their failure to complete that move, their results since, and his departure from a successful Vitality roster — one that went on to win titles without him — leaves a bitter taste. Not only has his form dipped (1.05 LAN rating with Falcons, 1.14 in his last six months with Vitality), but I'm remiss to think of the other possible destinations he could have gone to when he made the transfer to the maligned Falcons roster, whether they were on the table or not. To FaZe for a departing Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken? Fire. G2 in place of nexa? No doubt. Staying on Vitality? Not hard to imagine what could have been. Even a reunion with Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz on Astralis, if Magisk would actually return to the organization, leaves one salivating. This was a point I made on Snake & Banter in December, and though it didn't seem to age well with Falcons' playoff run in Katowice, it's one that I look back on now with sadness as to what could have been. - Danish ""Nohte"" Allana The Spanish-speaking world was taken by surprise when AWPer Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez joined 9z. Most in Spain considered it a lateral move at best, perhaps incentivized by a better paycheck, but boy, is he proving everyone wrong. The 23-year-old had recently taken up the spot previously held by Spain's most prolific player ever, Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García, and given the chance to prove himself on the world stage with his country's flag-bearing team, Movistar Riders (now KOI), who often compete at events like ESL Pro League, can win mid-level LANs such as ESL Challengers, and even qualify to Majors on occasion. Then Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez did what he does best: get AWPers to excel in his system. The team's two past AWPers, Santino ""try"" Rigal and Lucas ""nqz"" Soares, played their best while in 9z, and now MartinezSa is following that trend with a career-high 1.20 rating. It took a few months, but they went from a fringe top 30 team to 12th in the world after a Cinderella semi-final run at IEM Dallas and hoisting the trophy at the FiReLEAGUE Global Finals (where Dust2.com.br named 'Marti' their MVP). It's hard to find hipster picks for the worst move.  Second-line Chinese teams adding random European players could be one. FURIA departing from their aggressive Andrei ""arT"" Piovezan-led style and giving Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo the keys could be a hot take to stoke the fire — although it probably doesn't qualify as it has been a transformation taking place since well before CS2 was out. But it's just as hard to pick one particular high-level train crash above the rest. Was nexa's return worse than gla1ve knowingly signing onto a dead team and having to end up leading a Polish lineup? Or Falcons failing to secure their star roster and the following meltdown that ensued after keeping Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas? Or Liquid investing hugely into an international squad just to never buy into one vision of the game and it all falling apart? What sets the removal of jks apart from the others is that it seemed completely unnecessary from the outside, and nobody has come out to dispel that line of thought. When G2 made the announcement, it was unanimously hailed as a lateral move. However, even lateral moves carry risk, and with nexa now benched after a not particularly prolific period, that seems to be the case — made worse in hindsight by the fact that they had won a Katowice and Cologne double in 2023 with the Australian. - Lucas Aznar Miles",2-7-2024 12:00,1719914400000
ICY leaves AMKAL,https://www.hltv.org/news/39334/icy-leaves-amkal,"The AWPer is rumored to be in Cloud9's crosshairs. AMKAL has announced that 19-year-old AWPer Kaisar ""ICY"" Faiznurov will not continue with the team, adding more fuel to the rumors that have him set to land on Cloud9. The North American organization is rebuilding its team around Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov and Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov, the only two players left, and an experiment in playing without a dedicated AWPer following Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov's departure did not pan out. The Kazakhstani player was being investigated by AMKAL to ""determine if there has been any unfair behavior from the player toward the organization,"" but it ultimately seems like it came to nothing, and he is no longer tied to the team he had been playing for since December 2023. After joining AMKAL from AVANGAR at the turn of the year, ICY made his first Major appearance at the PGL Major in Copenhagen, where he averaged a 1.04 rating and 1.21 impact in the team's 0-3 run in the Opening Stage. ICY didn't get much chance to play on LAN with AMKAL, attending only the Major and its RMR, but a 1.15 overall rating garnered enough attention for him to secure a transfer. AMKAL is currently: Vladislav ""Krad"" Kravchenko Igor ""Forester"" Bezotecheskiy Aleksandr ""TRAVIS"" Timkiv Daniil ""Sdaim"" Tupov Svyatoslav ""svyat"" Dovbakh (coach)",2-7-2024 12:40,1719916800000
"ZywOo interview: Not enjoying fame, six years at Vitality, and his future",https://www.hltv.org/news/39332/zywoo-interview-not-enjoying-fame-six-years-at-vitality-and-his-future,"The French superstar sat down with HLTV for a lengthy chat about his career. HLTV sat down with Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut before the player break to talk about all things Counter-Strike in an in-depth interview conducted by Jason ""moses"" O'Toole. The duo touched on several topics throughout the interview, ranging from his time in Vitality to some more personal subjects. The French superstar began the interview by looking back at his career in Vitality, where he spent six years. ""It's now not only people working for me. It's more friends, and it's awesome to have them behind,"" he began. ""I don't care about being the superstar because, in the end, they are all just my friends. They don't see me as ZywOo but as Mathieu Herbaut, that's why I like them. Whenever I see their smile, I'm just happy to see them."" ZywOo had a plethora of teammates throughout his six years in Vitality, but Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire was a constant presence across the superstar's time in the organization. The Frenchman also transformed into a respected IGL during their time together, and ZywOo says he always saw him as a leadership figure. ""When we had the discussion about who should take over as the IGL, it was 100% clear he is the next leader for me,"" he said. ""We can just follow his call because we know it's going to be a good call. We try to help him, but when he makes a call, his energy ensures it's a good one."" The conversation transitioned to his enjoyment of CS, and the Frenchman admitted he doesn't enjoy the limelight. ""When I'm playing games, I don't feel anything because I know what I'm doing. I'm more afraid of speaking in front of people than playing."" He was then asked about the best and worst aspects of being a pro player and gave a simple answer. ""We are going from one tournament to another so fast, so sometimes it's really hard to enjoy it,"" he said about the negatives. ""But the first thing that makes me enjoy it is winning. laughs Also, having all this chemistry with your teammates. You can feel all five connected on the server and feel really good, and when you are in a good team bubble, you can beat anyone."" ZywOo then shared that he doesn't watch demos to prepare, something that has become a staple of top-tier CS in recent years. ""I'm watching the game while I'm playing, and I see things instantly, but I'm never rewatching it. Once I have seen it once, I don't need to see it twice."" The interview ended with ZywOo looking to the future, and he admitted he doesn't think about it yet. ""For me, I'm living day by day, not thinking about the future and what I'm going to do, or if I'm going to be a coach or manager. Just enjoying the moment.""

Who are 2024's rookies?,https://www.hltv.org/news/39303/who-are-2024s-rookies,"We take a look at the frontrunners, outsiders, and ones to watch from this year's newest batch of top-tier players. First things first, we're going to drop the charade. It would take a cataclysmic event to stop Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets from winning Rookie of the Year at 2024's HLTV Awards in Belgrade. But there's an intriguing race for the last two spots on the podium behind Spirit's star man. Counter-Strike 2 has brought with it a new generation of players, and it is only right that we shine a light on this new intake, so come along for the ride with us, forget about donk, and let's dive into the race to be the second-best rookie of 2024. Our usual top 20 event list of MVP events and RMRs has been extended to increase the sample size for the rookies: At the turn of 2024, our candidates must meet the following criteria, and age is deliberately not included to give late bloomers like last year's winner, Guy ""NertZ"" Iluz, a chance even if their career is stalled by factors outside of their control. It is all about being new to tier one. Criteria- Fewer than 30 maps versus Top 20 opposition on LAN- Fewer than 5 Big events (including Super-Elite play-ins)- No appearances at the second (Legends/Elimination) stage of a Major- Fewer than 20 weeks in the Top 20 of our ranking One more thing on donk, though: This is on track for as good a rookie year as Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut in 2019, and better than Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy in 2021 or Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov in 2022. His soon-to-be iconic mushroom radar (just missing clutches and survivals) from EVP articles appears again here, smashing the rookie competition in every other category. But let's not spend too much time here; donk's competition is not in the rookie category. Next in our alphabetical list of the top five frontrunners is Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar, the highest-rated player for The MongolZ's charge up the rankings. The 17-year-old is an aggressive rifler full of multi-kill potential, and has farmed local competition on LAN all year with a 1.39 rating at eXTREMESLAND, 1.35 at MESA Pro Series Finals, and a 1.29 at the half-Asian and half-European Nomadic Masters. He has also stepped up abroad, earning an EVP at YaLLa Compass after playing a huge role in the victorious final against Ninjas in Pyjamas. Ali ""Wicadia"" Haydar Yalçın burst onto the scene late in 2023, showing good signs at EPL18 and consistency in grand final placings at PARI Please and ESL Jönköping. A great Copenhagen Major is the bedrock of his case for a year in which he has not quite realized his full potential. His rough edges are most visible on the CT side, where he has a 1.02 rating (compared to 1.16 on T), but there is no doubt that the talent is there for Wicadia to end up on the podium come January. Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia is Spirit's able third star. He plays anchor on CT and is happy to be the team player on T, which can sometimes leave him in the shadow of donk. But you get the impression that this is where he's most comfortable; he is media-shy despite having great English, weary of boring questions and just wanting to focus on his game. His personality also shines through in his game, where his distinctive body-shotting style puts him on a headshot percentage of 36.2% for the year, and lets him farm ADR and assists where other players might miss the head and leave with nothing. This suits his strong anchor play, and you can see this in the fact that 77% of his kills come in round wins; when zont1x frags, they are nearly always full of impact. Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch won Mongolia's first-ever HLTV MVP at YaLLa Compass, and has had an impressive year despite starting it disappointingly at IEM Katowice. The 21-year-old benefits from our age-free criteria as the only frontrunner out of the teens, and is also the only AWPer on the list. With riflers like Senzu and Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren generally controlling the early round for The MongolZ, it often falls on 910 to be his team's savior in late rounds with some good clutch potential and a superb survival rate of 39%. Of course, there are more than five eligible rookies. In fact, there are a whopping 163 who have already played at a notable event in 2024. Here are just a few of them. These are the heavy hitters who just missed out on the top five of the mid-season update, with Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz and Max ""maxster"" Jansson entering the race after strong YaLLa Compass performances. Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa lack deep runs and sample size but are supposedly set for big moves to Cloud9 and G2, respectively, which might help them over the edge. Kirill ""Magnojez"" Rodnov has been praised by Vladislav ""nafany"" Gorshkov recently, as the highly-rated Spirit Academy graduate has elevated BetBoom's level single-handedly. Finally, Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing is best-placed out of a trio of rookies on SAW. While it's not impossible that these players will also be eligible in 2025, they are racking up enough sample size that it is, at the very least, unlikely. Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros was one of the frontrunners at the turn of 2024 after his move to Liquid, but after a poor six months he will have to improve hugely upon his expected return to Brazil with FURIA to get back into the race. Iulian ""regali"" Harjău, free to move after Entropiq pulled out of CS, will also be hoping for a move that can elevate him up the rankings. The rest of the list, with players like Lucas ""lux"" Meneghini, Lucas ""decenty"" Bacelar, and Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold, are all solid players on good teams but unlikely to climb much further. Last but not least, we have the wildcards. GamerLegion, under the tutelage of Ashley ""ash"" Battye, have assembled a very exciting trio of Henrich ""sl3nd"" Hevesi, Andreas ""aNdu"" Maasing, and Timur ""FL4MUS"" Marev. Able Russian anchors Timur ""clax"" Sabirov and Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov are also still eligible, though they might struggle to get onto LAN too much for the rest of the year. Matúš ""MATYS"" Šimko has been an able second star to Benjamin ""blameF"" Bremer in fnatic, and the Dane's arrival could help the Slovakian climb the list. Linus ""nilo"" Bergman was the big winner in the 2023 top 20's bold predictions but has been hampered by school and we still await his true arrival to tier one. Keep up to date with all things HLTV Awards at hltv.org/awards Overall, it's many names — and so much CS is left to play. donk may have all but guaranteed the award, but plenty of intrigue is left before we crown the best of the class of 2024 at the HLTV Awards in January.",3-7-2024 10:24,1719995040000
Skyesports increase prize pool and team count for Mumbai Championship,https://www.hltv.org/news/39336/skyesports-increase-prize-pool-and-team-count-for-mumbai-championship,"The Indian tournament organizer has revealed the format for the now $300,000 LAN. Skyesports have announced an additional four invites for their Championship event, slated to be held between July 23-28 in Mumbai, India. The four invitees will join eight pre-invited teams in two six-team round-robin groups, with the top three teams from each pool moving on to single-elimination playoffs. That takes the total team count to 12, and they have also increased the prize pool by $100,000 to $300,000 in total to reflect the increased attendance. It is not the first big international LAN Skyesports has attempted to host, and the fledgling tournament organizer will be hoping for a smoother ride after various disrupted events, including Skyesports Masters 2024, that was moved online at late notice. Previously, the South Asian tournament organizer indefinitely postponed the Skyesports Championship 5.0 in November 2023 over ""foreign political conditions and a little bit of bad luck"". They also moved the Skyesports Souvenir tournament online after it was originally announced as a LAN in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Five top 30 teams have already accepted invites for the new event, including The MongolZ, Eternal Fire, and FURIA, and it is also set to debut Indian organization Revenant's new Nathan ""NBK-"" Schmitt-led roster. 3DMAX emerged victorious from the European qualifier over BLEED to take that count to six, while True Rippers defeated Gods Reign in the local Indian qualifier.

GamerLegion part ways with Snax,https://www.hltv.org/news/39335/gamerlegion-part-ways-with-snax,"The organization's youthful core has lost its most experienced member. Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski has bid farewell to GamerLegion after nine months as the team's in-game leader. ""Snax, ever the hungry beast, cannot be contained,"" GamerLegion said in a statement, implying his next team has already been found. ""He will move on, ready to continue wreaking havoc on the server."" This means that Sebastian ""volt"" Maloș, after Isak ""isak"" Fahlén's departure to Ninjas in Pyjamas, is the last survivor of the GamerLegion lineup that attended PGL Major Copenhagen. The rebuild, led by coach Ashley ""ash"" Battye, has been centered on youth with the signing of three teenagers: Henrich ""sl3nd"" Hevesi, Andreas ""aNdu"" Maasing, and Timur ""FL4MUS"" Marev as isak's replacement. If the plan was for them to develop under the guise of 30-year-old veteran Snax, that plan has been scuppered and GamerLegion now must enter the difficult market for a new in-game leader. The Polish legend — a three-time top-five player of the year — took up the captaincy role of the international Let us cook lineup early in 2023 and earned a step up to GamerLegion in September of that year. Results improved after he replaced Sanzhar ""neaLaN"" Iskhakov, though Snax could not stop GamerLegion's slide down the rankings as their grand final run at BLAST.tv Paris Major lost relevancy. Regardless, Snax proved he could be a decent captain for an international side; a task he is expected to continue in his next, currently unannounced, project.

G2 unveil Snax signing,https://www.hltv.org/news/39338/g2-unveil-snax-signing,"It's not NiKo in-game leading, after all, as G2 give the reins to the battle-tested Pole in a move out of left field. G2 have unveiled the signing of Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski to their Counter-Strike roster. The Polish veteran takes over in-game leadership in the squad from Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen, who was benched from the team on Monday. The new addition is part of a larger overhaul of the G2 team and comes on the coattails of former M80 star Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa replacing Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković on the roster. The two arrivals will make roles inside the new roster difficult to solve. Snax could be seen as a one-to-one replacement for HooXi in many ways, but he has been used to more rotator roles as CT and was much less of a pure entry on T side compared to the man he's replacing, while malbsMd's positions from his former team clash with either Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač or Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač on most maps. There isn't a lot of time for G2 to solve that puzzle by the time they make their debut in the new season. That is just two weeks away, taking place at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from July 17-21. Snax joins G2 on a transfer from GamerLegion, with whom he made a return to tier-one play last September and further honed his craft as a leader, a role he also previously took up on and off as part of the legendary Virtus.pro roster. This transfer marks a reunion between Snax and Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas, who have a longstanding relationship dating back to when they played together from 2013 to 2018 from that same Virtus.pro team. Their relationship was rumored to be fraught towards the end of their time together, but the duo won a dozen titles — including the EMS One Katowice Major on home soil in 2014 — marking a golden era for Polish Counter-Strike. G2's new roster looks as follows: Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas (coach)",3-7-2024 18:05,1720022700000
Stat check: G2 throws roles out the window,https://www.hltv.org/news/39326/stat-check-g2-throws-roles-out-the-window,"Snax and malbsMd arrive to a team full of talent, but even more full of position overlaps. G2 are an organization that need trophies. In Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov, they have either the best player in the world or top three, depending on who you ask. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač is a legacy rifler, and was a top two player just one year ago. The manner of G2's win at IEM Dallas, their first title for nine months, was always going to have consequences. First, they proved they could win without Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen. Secondly, Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip's maniacal aggression helped unlock G2's other riflers. It's not hard to see them celebrating that night, just wondering how good they could be if they could get someone who was as aggressive as Stewie2K, but far more capable of shooting back. Enter Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa. The Guetemalan is super-aggressive on both sides, and it doesn't take a genius scout to notice a player who hit a 1.29 rating in M80's slog of a win over G2 at ESL Pro League. malbsMd has torn teams to shreds with impeccable first bullet aim this year, but has only played 33 maps at notable LANs, and just 6 maps against top 10 teams. When it comes to roles, too, there are problems. The assumption after Dallas was that a rifler like malbsMd would be replacing HooXi, and one of NiKo or Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač would take over in-game leadership to translate their miracle run into the next season. Then, a specialist anchor like Ilya ""Perfecto"" Zalutskiy could come in for Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković to create a high-octane all-fragging superteam. Instead, malbsMd has come in for nexa — G2's ultra-passive, supportive, lurker — and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski will be the new captain (and expect the roles that come with that). malbsMd's aggression is what attracted G2 to him, but unless there are some fairly heavy role changes it is hard to see him being able to have the same impact. The puzzle is helped if Snax — who played some star roles himself on GamerLegion — can slot into HooXi's bottom of the barrel CT roles, but you still need an extra anchor. NiKo is NiKo, and any changes to his CT positions would be insane. So that leaves huNter- or malbsMd, or a combination of the two. ""People are saying huNter- should anchor, and I think that is so stupid,""  weighed in Mohan ""launders"" Govindasamy on YouTube. ""huNter- is like a squirrel, have you ever seen him play CS? He is one of the most mobile players ever."" launders' comment rings true, but it's not like malbsMd is a turret. Combine this with huNter-'s middling form (he has a 1.05 CT rating in positions where you would expect a 1.06 rating), and you can see the case for a position swap. History, however, would indicate it's malbsMd, the young fragger, who is more likely to have to sacrifice his spots. On some maps, that won't be too huge of an issue. He can play A Anchor on Ancient, and still do plenty of aggressive work in Middle (his old spot) at the start of the round. He already plays Ramp on Nuke, where he has a 0.84 rating in a tiny sample size of 26 rounds. If this low rating is due to the sample size and not any discomfort, you can see him moving to more anchor spots in the future. Long on Dust2 might suit his space-taking, too. But it's these crucial small sites, where executes in swing rounds onto a single CT player often decide entire maps, that should concern G2. There was a clamor in the community for Perfecto in this team for a reason. Move too much, peek too wide, and the round is over in positions like A on Anubis or Pit on Inferno. These spots call for specialist anchors, ones who do not die cheaply and are capable of round-winning multi-frags. Neither malbsMd or huNter- will be natural fits in these positions. Even if it is huNter- taking the hit, malbsMd might struggle to call his own plays in a team with domineering CT playmakers like m0NESY and NiKo. You can point to firepower, the way Astralis did when they signed Martin ""stavn"" Lund and Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard to create a quadruple-rotator rifling core themselves. But we saw what happened there: Form dropping off a cliff in new spots, a power struggle, and then more roster changes. What's more, we have not even begun to talk about the changes required on the T side. nexa was criticized often in his second stint at G2, sometimes unfairly because of the affection many hold for Justin ""jks"" Savage, considering they had similar CT ratings, but on T side he had clear faults as a lurker. ""jks had the ability to single-handedly open up a site for G2, much like ropz does for FaZe,"" tweeted Faruk ""pita"" Pita in April. ""On the flip side, nexa isn't that type of player. He is more of an old-school lurker, patiently waiting to execute the correct macro-play rather than seizing upon micro-timings."" ""Opponents facing G2 can reliably anticipate little action from nexas positions, allowing them to concentrate their utility and manpower where the group most likely will come, forcing them, and NiKo especially into challenging battles around nades."" So nexa has gone. Fine. But malbsMd is not a lurker. In-game leader Snax is not anymore, either. huNter-, again, seems the likeliest candidate to take the hit and move to pure lurker roles. In CS:GO, huNter- was a specialist in the 'flex' role, in spots like Boiler on Inferno, Silo on Nuke, or B on Anubis. These are almost half-lurk spots, where you are usually the lurker who joins the '4' in 4-1 defaults and in late-rounds when executes happen. It will not be easy for him to become a full-time lurker, though his more active style will exploit the 'micro-timings' pita speaks of far more than nexa. NiKo, two-time Opener of the year, could also undergo a change to make his spots more in line with his old FaZe and MOUZ days. He already is a bit of a lurker in spots like B on Ancient, Banana on Inferno, or Outside on Nuke for 1-4 defaults. NiKo is at his best prowling for openings on his own, and can do that from any position on the map. Mirage will be a good example. It makes sense for NiKo to become the B Apps and Underpass player, huNter- A, and leave malbsMd and Snax taking Mid. On Ancient, huNter- can become the A lurker (who is more of a supportive Mid rifler) and malbsMd can take Mid. On Anubis, Snax could take B lurking (as some IGLs already do) and leave huNter- A, NiKo Mid, and malbsMd in Canals. It is not as hard a puzzle as CT side, even before you consider how fluid positions are as the Ts in 2024's Counter-Strike. It's probably easier to think outside of lurker-pack dimensions for the new G2's T side, with Snax as the supportive grenadier, huNter- the key trade fragger, NiKo the lone wolf, and malbsMd as the bomb-site entry. That can be the case from any 'default' spread. Here, we can see that nexa, in spite of low openers and his lurker roles, was getting his deaths traded more than huNter- and supposed entry NiKo. Even if malbsMd, for some reason, is the one shifted to lurking in defaults, we should expect him to continue being the bomb-site entry nexa often was. Snax's presence in the bottom left of the chart is more of a concern, considering how sacrificial HooXi often was. From this chart, we see Snax is more of an individualistic space taker, rarely having a teammate there to trade him. With malbsMd happy to take up that duty, this might not be a problem. But as with Astralis, there is another warning from the last off-season in the form of Liquid and Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis. malbsMd profiles similarly to YEKINDAR, a star space taker more than a willing bomb-site entry-fragging soldier. If Snax is a more passive (and less selfless) IGL like he was in GamerLegion, more like the supportive Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire style captain than HooXi's 'just-trade-me' entry fragging, malbsMd's duels will be far tougher than he is used to — and it will be a challenge to get him used to this. So it is easier than CT side, but far from easy. This puts pressure on G2, and on malbsMd especially. Young players, especially confidence-based duellers like malbsMd, can easily struggle under the stress of so much change. This piece has rarely lingered on his obvious individual quality precisely because, such is the role change expected, it might not even matter. You can argue that firepower was a problem for G2 with huNter-'s drop-off, and after nexa came in for jks. But it seemed like they needed a passive star, a better version of jks like Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa, Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko, or Perfecto, rather than a firebrand like malbsMd if a traditional IGL like HooXi or Snax would remain. Instead, general manager Petar ""peca"" Marković and coach Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas have decided to overturn any existing structure entirely. NiKo and huNter-, remember, extended their contracts for ""a fuckton of years and a half"" in May 2022, but GM peca confirmed to HLTV that their deals go ""well over 2024"", so this is not as immediate a concern as some have thought. This lowers the likelihood of any conspiracy theory behind the malbsMd move that would have him be the long-term NiKo replacement as G2 rebuild around m0NESY as their new franchise star. Which makes sense. It would be folly for any organization to consider NiKo surplus to requirements. Only Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets has matched his ceiling at the very top of tier one as a pure rifler, and that is true in CS2 as well. We must, therefore, take this move at face value. malbsMd is an addition to this G2, not a futureproofing plan. This leaves them open to scrutiny.  HooXi was a lightning rod for criticism, but his departure has opened the whole team and backroom staff to that pressure. m0NESY is too good not to have a team around him capable of a charge at the top spot. His peak is currently being wasted, and frustration will rightly grow inside of him if G2 continues to meander into playoffs but no further in CS2's biggest events. Can malbsMd, out of his comfort zone in new roles, and Snax, who did not achieve anything too special at GamerLegion, really be the ones to drive G2 there? It is perhaps unsurprising that TaZ and Snax, who swapped roles every five seconds in Virtus.pro, will be the conductors of this chaotic orchestra. But Counter-Strike has changed. Roles matter, even in a team with m0NESY and NiKo. G2 required changes this off-season, but there were routes to go down with just as much upside and far less risk. Signing malbsMd is more than a gamble; it's an unnecessary one. At IEM Dallas, G2 showed they had the talent to defy logic. Next season, that will be their full-time job.",4-7-2024 13:35,1720092900000
ENCE invited to Skyesports Championship,https://www.hltv.org/news/39341/ence-invited-to-skyesports-championship,"The international team will return to action later this month in India. ENCE have accepted an invitation to compete at Skyesports Championship, the event's organizer has announced. This follows Skyesports' decision to expand the international tournament from eight to 12 teams and increase the prize pool by $100,000 to $300,000. ENCE are now the seventh top-30 team confirmed for the Indian event, joining The MongolZ, Eternal Fire, BetBoom, FURIA, Aurora, and 3DMAX. The team list also includes Revenant and local side True Rippers, the winner of the Indian closed qualifier.

"kassad: ""nexa's stats in the last six months don't reflect his capabilities at all""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39342/kassad-nexas-stats-in-the-last-six-months-dont-reflect-his-capabilities-at-all,"The BLEED coach believes that his new player can return to his old form in a different system and under less pressure. BLEED enter the new tournament season with a fresh face after signing Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković from G2 to replace Josef ""faveN"" Baumann in the latest of a series of shrewd transfer business conducted by head coach (and general manager) Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović. This will be the third time that the two Serbians will work together after previous spells on iNation and Renegades earlier in their careers. As someone who knows nexa better than most, kassad didn't think twice about getting his compatriot on board despite his largely disappointing G2 spell. ""It was an easy choice for me,"" he told HLTV, pointing to faveN's struggles in the anchor role when explaining the need for a change. BLEED have changed quite a bit since the Singaporean organization entered CS, at the start of this year, with Hampus ""hampus"" Poser and Cai ""CYPHER"" Watson being the only remaining players from the original lineup. Before nexa was signed, kassad was able to pick up Joakim ""jkaem"" Myrbostad and Tim ""nawwk"" Jonasson, bolstering his squad with two experienced and more reliable players than Tsvetelin ""CeRq"" Dimitrov and Vladan ""VLDN"" Radević (the latter had been brought in as a replacement for Laurențiu ""lauNX"" Țârlea). With all these changes, there's a new level of excitement surrounding BLEED ahead of the new season. kassad sets his sights on the Shanghai Major, but he doesn't want to get tunnel vision and forget about what else is out there. ""Even though Shanghai is a big goal, it's not the biggest possible goal,"" he said, in a reference to the open circuit in 2025. Speaking to HLTV days before nexa's unveiling, kassad discussed his thinking behind the latest change, the mistakes he has made since he took the project's reins, and his goals for the rest of the year and beyond. You recently made two roster changes, bringing in jkaem and nawwk. So why did you decide to also get nexa now? Was replacing faveN something you had been considering, or was the opportunity to get nexa too good to pass up? Well, there are several reasons, to be honest. First of all, we didn't really expect to make any changes. The plan was not to make any changes in this player break. But we realized that nexa had popped up on the market. hampus and I talked about it and realized we really needed an anchor instead of faveN. I have to say this publicly: faveN wasn't doing great in that role, not because he's a bad player; he's actually a really good player, really hard-working. It was very hard for me to make this decision because he was the one sacrificing the most on the team and I had to make this move for the bigger picture because this role wasn't meant for him at all. And I think he couldn't really handle it properly. He's going to be good on any other team where he doesn't get this role, and he's going to be playing much better because he's a really good player. And it was a really tough decision for me to remove him. But nexa popped up on the market, like I said, and we had to discuss this option. There were three options for the anchor spot. It was jks, nexa and bringing VLDN back from the bench. After negotiations and all those things that happened in the last few weeks, we chose nexa. nexa comes from a rough spell with G2. He was very criticized from the moment he joined the team, a lot of people doubted that he was capable of replacing jks in that anchor role. When you spoke with him, what was his state of mind? Was he like, 'I'm determined to prove people wrong, I'm determined to prove that I'm still a tier-one player'? What was it like? What did he say to you? He sounded fine. I think, at least from what I could understand, he was maybe a little bit relieved that this happened with G2. I don't know what happened behind the scenes with the team, but I know he wasn't the happiest there. The thing with nexa is that his stats in the last six months don't really reflect his capabilities at all. If he is put in a different type of environment, in different situations, and if he is given a little bit more freedom, I think he can go back to his normal level, which is much higher than what he was showing in the last six, seven months with G2. He sounded okay. He wants to get back to the grind, and it was enough for me when I spoke to him. I have known him personally for a long time, and I know exactly what he can and cannot do. So in that sense, it was an easy choice for me. And do you think that the fact he won't have as much pressure as he used to will help him get back to his old level? Absolutely. One hundred percent. Like I said, he will get a little bit more freedom here, and the environment is different. Not to say anything bad about G2, I don't want people to misunderstand that. I'm just saying that the system and the whole thing will be a little different. Obviously, there will be a little less pressure than when you're in G2, where everyone expects you to win all the trophies. They've had that ever since NiKo joined. And it's not only on NiKo, it's on HooXi, it's on nexa, it's on everyone there. The last six months were rough for G2 and nexa. I think you are right when you say there won't be as much pressure as there was on G2, and that will help him go back to his normal form. I wanted to ask about nexa's role in the team. Is he going to help hampus in terms of leadership? Will he be like a secondary voice on the team, or is someone else doing that already? What I've told him is that he has the freedom and he can be as vocal as he wants. I'm not going to put pressure on him to do secondary calling or anything. I want him to focus on himself,  to bring his form up, and just focus on his role and his play. We have a whole system where hampus and I are developing everything strategically. At least next season, he needs to completely focus on himself and on how can be the best version of the player that he is. And he's going to get all the help he needs for that, starting with the bootcamp on the 8th of July. faveN showed a lot of promise earlier in his career, but he seems to have fallen off a bit. Why do you think things didn't work out between him and the team? This is very important for people to know. Josef is a very, very good player. He was put into these different positions from the very start and it kind of sucked for him because we couldn't really move him into better positions and roles and give him more responsibility because we had more aggressive players. So he needed to take a step back. The last month, month and a half, ever since we brought in jkaem and nawwk, was not a true representation of his capabilities. I think he can be an asset to any international team or even a German team, if he wants to go down that route. For him, it just sucked that he had to sacrifice a lot for the team, which was kind of reflected in his stats, and people are going to look at that. But the real picture is that he is a super good team player. He never complains about anything. He took on all of the roles that we gave him. And the sacrifices that he had to make, he made them without any hesitation, and it took a toll on him. Sadly and unfortunately, the anchor position is the one that doesn't fit him, and that was the position that we really needed. So that's why the change happened. You've made some changes to the roster since you put the team together, and I guess it's undeniable that you've made some very smart decisions. You refused to overpay for players; for example with jkaem and nawwk, you waited until Apeks was in crisis to get them. Now you're getting nexa, who was on the bench and, I would assume, was fairly cheap as well. Are you happy with the team as it is right now? And if you had to give me a percentage, how much better is this team now compared to the initial roster? I would say it's twice as good as it was six months ago, in terms of the lineup, the structure and everything going on inside the team. I think it's much, much better than what we had six months ago, because BLEED had never been in CS. So there was nothing going on, we had to build it from scratch. The same goes with, as you mentioned, the player transfers. I didn't want to follow the market, where everything was overinflated and people were paying ridiculous amounts of money for players that didn't have that value in the market at all. So I just waited and waited. However, it doesn't mean that I was sure I was going to make changes or that I was going to bring this or that player. Every player that was on this team at the beginning had a fair chance in every possible way and had all the help they needed. If you don't make it, well, this is a performance-based industry, and sometimes changes need to happen. And they did on our team. Now, I think we have a pretty stable roster, with roles pretty much on the spot. The only little bit of clash we have is between jkaem and CYPHER because they're both super aggressive. So we've had to swap some of the positions there to make it work for everyone. And I have to mention that hampus took a bit of a step back on some maps to give more freedom to jkaem and CYPHER. He was very happy to do it. We are still in the process of figuring out small details, but we are close to getting to the place where we need to be. Like I said, we will have a bootcamp soon, where we're going to polish these things and then we're going to start a new season. How long is that bootcamp going to be? This bootcamp will last two weeks, from the 8th to the 22nd of July. We opted not to go for a classic bootcamp, like at Relog, which has been really good to us, and decided to go in a different direction for this one. Hampus has a big summer house on the lake and we're going to do the bootcamp there for the whole CS division with eight people, the players, me, my assistant coach and the manager. We're going to have the PCs delivered and everything set up there for this one. We're going to work on some team building, and we're obviously going to practice and isolate ourselves completely from the outside world. We're just going to play and stay together for the next two weeks. It was hampus' idea, and I supported it. We're going to see how it goes. That's the plan for the first bootcamp of the season, to try to prepare for the closed qualifier for the RMR, especially because we have three new players, basically. So this bootcamp and team building will come along really nicely. Considering how fresh the roster was when you were in Mongolia, were you happy that the team reached the final and took a map off of TheMongolZ? I'm happy with what we did in one month, but I think we could have done way more. But I'm not dissatisfied. We had like six or seven days of practice before Mongolia. Literal practice. All the other days were only games and games and games. Games are always good. You can build a lot of things by playing online games. But sometimes you need a little bit more practice to kind of polish some things, to avoid simple mistakes that usually don't happen to better teams. And we didn't have time for that. That's why we made some silly mistakes in some games. But overall, I'm happy with how the team performed, especially with nawwk. He is one of the best AWPers I have had in my career, so I'm happy we got him. It was based on hampus' recommendation. He and I decide pretty much what needs to happen, which players we should get and how we should approach these things. He told me we needed to get Tim, and I told him about jkaem, and we made a deal and we brought the two of them. I'm super, super happy with how Tim performed because I didn't really know what to expect. I knew how good jkaem could be because we worked together for years, but I didn't know how good Tim was. And I was extremely surprised. I think he's maybe one of the ten best AWPers in CS right now. It has now been eight months since you joined BLEED. How do you look back at the journey so far? And what goals have you set out for the rest of the year? Is reaching the Major a must for the team? The first month, after I signed, there was a lot of scrambling, a lot of problems, because the organization didn't have a CS division. So everything needed to be done in a very specific way, in a very fast manner, and obviously, there are going to be some mistakes if you do something fast. There were some mistakes at the beginning and some things could have been done better, but we're not going to cry about it too much. We know that those mistakes were part of the process and I was pretty sure that the first lineup we got was not going to be the final lineup. Because of the market, the fact that you started with zero points and you have to battle through online qualifiers, and also the fact that you have players you have never played with each other before. So we had five people who had never really spoken to each other, had never played with each other in official games. Maybe sometimes against each other, but that's it. And it can be really hard when you have five different personalities and you need to fit it all together. As for the second season, the goal is to qualify for the Shanghai Major: to get through the closed qualifier into the RMR and try to get our asses to Shanghai. And then I feel that 2025 will be a very big year for Counter-Strike because the partner leagues will be gone and everything will rely on Valve's ranking. All the invites and the qualifiers and everything. So we need to think about that. Yes, the Shanghai Major is pretty big and everything, but we need to think beyond that as well because CS is not going anywhere in the next ten years and they made this drastic change and we need to adapt to it and see how we're going to get our team into these events, like Cologne, Katowice, BLAST… I hear that StarLadder is maybe coming back. The calendar is going to be packed, so you need to think about that, too. So even though Shanghai is a big goal, it's not the biggest possible goal.",4-7-2024 18:32,1720110720000
NRG sign nitr0,https://www.hltv.org/news/39344/nrg-sign-nitr0,"One of North America's most storied players has found his home as he returns to Counter-Strike. NRG has announced the signing of Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella, who returns to CS after spending the first six months of 2024 playing VALORANT for M80. nitr0 will replace Colby ""Walco"" Walsh on the roster, who has parted ways with the team. The news confirms a recent HLTV and Dust2.us report stating that NRG were interested in the 28-year-old after his talks regarding transitioning to M80's CS division broke down. In joining NRG, nitr0 will reunite with former teammates Damian ""daps"" Steele and Josh ""oSee"" Ohm, both of whom he played with during his lengthy time on Liquid. ""We are thrilled to welcome nitr0 to our team,"" NRG said in a statement following the announcement of nitr0's signing. ""His resume speaks for itself, and we simply could not pass up the chance to sign one of the greatest North American IGL's in the history of the game to bolster our squad. It's been a slow start to NRG's return to CS, but we feel very confident the team will improve significantly in the second half of the year under nitr0's leadership."" The storied IGL will be hoping to revitalize a struggling NRG lineup who have failed to achieve much of note since the organization re-entered CS late last year. NRG suffered an inauspicious start upon their return to the game, the modest success of requalifying for ESL Challenger League marred by a string of failures in online qualifiers, including the qualifier for the PGL Copenhagen Major Americas RMR. The disqualification of Rocket granted NRG a reprieve and they were ultimately invited to compete at the Americas RMR, but the team were handily beaten by paiN and Imperial to exit the competition. Their failure in the Major circuit led NRG to revamp their squad, moving daps from a playing role to head coach, dropping Justin ""FaNg"" Coakley and bringing in Walco and Timothy ""autimatic"" Ta. NRG's results experienced a modest uptick but still they failed to make it through a string of online qualifiers, only to grab a surprise victory over M80 in their final appearance before the player break, which qualified the team for BLAST Fall Showdown 2024.

Jan ""Swani"" Müller is a man with an unorthodox career in Counter-Strike. The German tactician had no playing experience in the game and got his first analyst gig in ALTERNATE aTTaX back in 2016, before quickly rising to notoriety in the years that followed with notable stints in Liquid and SK and eventually settling at G2 in 2019. It was in the German organization that Swani would get his chance to lead a tier-one squad as a coach and the 29-year-old did so with aplomb, winning BLAST World Final, IEM Katowice, and IEM Cologne. But despite all the success, he ended his year-long stint behind the team due to the job taking a ""big toll"" on him at the end of 2023, and he announced his retirement from Counter-Strike shortly after in April 2024. Following his decision to end his career in the game, Swani sat down with HLTV for a lengthy chat about his decision and a behind-the-scenes look at his atypical rise to prominence. Editor's note: This interview was conducted on April 22, before ESL Pro League Season 19. Swani began by reminiscing about his start in Counter-Strike with 99Damage, a German broadcasting company and former news website. That helped him meet Christian ""crisby"" Schmitt, who asked him to help at ALTERNATE aTTaX sometime around ESWC 2016. ""I just said, 'Yeah, of course, why not?' I had no clue, it was never my intention to become an analyst or a coach. I just said, 'Fuck it, let's go,'"" recalls Swani. ""There would have been 20 better candidates than me, but we were good friends. We always talked about the game a lot, and I think he saw that I might have a good eye for the game, and he just gave me a shot."" With no professional experience in Counter-Strike, Swani says he is very thankful to the German organization that gave him his first analyst job. ""I didn't have any background playing professionally, so I had to learn from scratch. I was just there to create videos, to create Google Docs — I was literally spamming Google Docs. I obviously did way too much. I almost always wrote a book for them, which they obviously can't read and remember it all, but it was learning by doing. ""I'm also really thankful that the players and everyone had patience, and that they gave a shot to a new guy because aTTaX was always very ambitious, especially in the German scene. I'm very thankful for what they did for me,"" Swani says. That eventually led to Swani joining Liquid, which came about after the German responded to a Twitter post from the organization that stated they were looking for an analyst. He worked from home and was studying concurrently to have a backup plan, which means he didn't have much contact with the players. ""I only know from sitting in on scrims they were pretty good at listening to my feedback. They weren't arrogant, like I experienced from some players, because if you come in as a fresh guy with no experience and talk to experienced players like EliGE or something, it would be understandable if they wouldn't have time for you. But they were honestly pretty great to work with, and I learned a lot, especially from nitr0 as an IGL and the way he sees the game."" After his Liquid stint, he joined SK in 2017 in what proved to be another challenge for him to overcome. ""It was pretty weird because when I joined them, some players didn't even watch demos, they were just playing. But they were so good at playing that it didn't matter. ""But back then, people were starting to figure them out, and I think that's when they wanted some external help because it was going downhill a bit. Once you're the No. 1 team, you have a red dot on your back, and everyone wants to know what you're doing and how to beat you, so it's really hard to maintain a top spot nowadays. ""They were just asking me to help individuals, that was my only work. fer was asking me, 'How can I play Toilets better? How can I be smarter?' because he was like, 'I know that I'm playing stupid, but it was working all the time,' and then it's really hard for him to change his playstyle. ""It was really hard to get a good grip on the team because I don't speak the language, so for example, I didn't listen in scrims because it was useless. I just did what they asked me and tried to get them another view on the game, which I think worked pretty decently."" He then signed for NRG but was immediately told the team was dead after the Major, which led to his signing with FURIA, where he helped the Brazilians break Astralis' winstreak on Nuke with his game plan consisting of ""disruptive and stupid plays like going through smokes."" Next came an offer from G2, where Swani would eventually make his breakthrough into the head coach role of a tier-one organization. When the German joined the team, however, he was still in the analyst role, and the team housed a French roster featuring Kenny ""kennyS"" Schrub, who Swani says was his main focus. ""He is a really emotional guy, and as soon as things don't work out for him in the first round, he starts to tilt a bit, adjust his mouse a bit. He's the kind of guy if he had a good pistol, you knew he was going to pop off, but you could also see the doubts in his head when he was playing a bit slow."" Swani touched on the fact that he fulfilled the role of a mental coach when working with kennyS. ""His problems were more mental than mechanical. Every player needs individual treatment. It's really important to put the human side first. If you're a good human, you're nice to them, and if you listen to them, you get it back tenfold."" G2 then transitioned to a European team and eventually signed Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač in October 2020, with Swani describing the Bosnian superstar as ""the best teammate I worked with in G2 by far."" ""He started to bring a lot of reactions to the team, and his game sense was something I haven't experienced before. Combined with his eagerness to learn, even though he was pretty accomplished already, except for winning a Major smiles, he was so hungry for feedback. That lit a fire under everyone else too,"" Swani said waxing lyrical about NiKo. ""If people say he is toxic, he is slamming a desk, it's never because he is titled at someone, but because he wants to win so badly or he's mad at himself. He was never toxic to a teammate without a reason, and the reason was always to improve and to win the game."" He was then given the chance to work with another sensational player in Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov, and Swani says the Russian's impact was felt immediately. ""As soon as m0NESY joined, we finally had a good AWP. Not to be mean, but AMANEK wasn't an AWPer, and we never had this game-changing AWP that can win us games, at least in the international lineup,"" he said. ""When we saw what he could do in the first or second practice, we were like 'holy shit, we can start to win tournaments now.'"" While the talent was apparent, m0NESY still needed to improve a lot, which became Swani's role for a while. The German coach recalls the youngster didn't have many strings to his bow and would, for example, start almost all rounds on Mirage in Window, so he worked with him to get several different openings. ""When we started giving him openings like this, he began to say he wanted to do them by himself in one or two weeks."" The team then signed a new IGL in Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen, and Swani was honest in his assessment of the team. ""The team was set up for failure,"" he recalls, and says that the players didn't fit the system, Rémy ""XTQZZZ"" Quoniam and Aleksib were both pretty systematic, and the Frenchman's English wasn't the best. ""What we lacked most was that we were too systematic. Ilya was supporting a lot when he should have been more explosive. It was easy to read us, Ilya never did anything crazy with the AWP, and we were pretty execute-heavy."" Swani did reserve some praise for the Finnish captain and said he always had some problems in previous teams in terms of people getting used to his style or his relationship with a coach. ""Now you can see what he can do with young players who are buying into his system, trusting him, and doing everything he demands them to do."" All the struggles meant Aleksib was replaced by Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen, who was a newcomer to the tier-one scene. ""It was not easy from the start. It was really hard for him to adapt to an international team,"" Swani recalls. ""He came from Copenhagen Flames, where he played with friends, and he was never really a tier-one IGL or player before. He had issues adapting. He always told me that he isn't scared but that he respects them all a lot and that it's hard for him to have authority sometimes. The first few months were really tough due to the team dynamic. We also had Justin, who was really silent, and we had to make that work too."" The IGL change was soon followed by Swani taking over the head coach role from XTQZZZ for the first time in his career in what he describes as a sudden change. ""I was told 'you are the coach now,'"" says Swani, and shares that he didn't have much time to change anything until the end of the year. ""At the World Final Swani's second event as head coach, we weren't expecting to get out of groups. We got to know HooXi's dad died when we were flying to Abu Dhabi, and when you get that kind of message, you don't think about the tournament. He was thinking about flying back, but he said he wanted to make his dad proud. As bad as it sounds, that put us together like crazy, as the team wanted to do everything for him."" G2 went on to win the tournament, with Swani saying that the win gave them the belief that they could win tournaments for the rest of their time together. The team went on to win one more Big Event at IEM Katowice but came crashing down at the Paris Major, where they were eliminated with a 1-3 record by fnatic in the Legends Stage. ""During the Major, players were tense,"" he began. ""We didn't want to have this feeling of not qualifying ever again in our lives because it just felt so bad. People were doubting and not trusting each other, and people wanted to make the difference individually, which didn't work. It was very different from what we practiced and the system we wanted to have. ""I also fucked up the veto against fnatic and went with Vertigo. We talked about the map a lot in theory about what we wanted to do. Back then, I was learning and still in the phase of an analyst, where you work on your paper, be prepared, and want to avoid unknown territory. But that was a big mistake and a big learning I took out of this that players are smart and skilled enough to play by their feelings without having talked about the map in theory."" The lackluster form continued at IEM Dallas and BLAST Premier Spring Final 2023, with Swani describing those two events as ""their lowest lows."" ""We openly talked to HooXi about the fact that he would be removed if he didn't improve his appearance. He was really down, super burned out, fully emo, and if your leader and IGL has his head down all the time, it has a huge effect on the team. We had a long and transparent talk with him about the fact he is our leader. We valued him highly, that's why we had this talk with him, but if he wouldn't improve then it's his bad, and he would be removed. ""It was good that we were transparent and were telling him these things because he realized it as well, he needed some kick up the ass. We took those tournaments as a bit of a vacation, which you shouldn't do, but we saw that it's not going well, and we need to work on the team dynamic. NiKo was calling a bit more on the T side because HooXi didn't feel comfortable. When your leader doesn't feel good and when he's calling stuff, he sounds different. I think this wake-up call really helped him because it revitalized HooXi again."" G2 then returned to world-beating form after the player break and won IEM Cologne, and Swani says that their previous struggles had a big impact on the result. ""We were telling him HooXi that we appreciate him, that we know we can win trophies with him, that he is a good IGL no matter what the outside says,"" he recalls. ""At that time, outside noise got to him a lot, which he improved. Now he doesn't give a shit anymore about what people who aren't on the team say. Everyone was telling him that they believed in him and didn't want to replace him, but that he needed to just work on himself, otherwise, it's just unbearable. It was nice to see the turnaround for Cologne."" Swani then talked about the Dane as an IGL and praised his work ethic and his ability to adapt a plan and make his team unpredictable. He did, however, say that HooXi and he were responsible for letting opponents back into the game, as the Dane sometimes wanted to rush things too much, while Swani admits he didn't take enough timeouts and left HooXi alone in games. A talking point of Swani's coaching tenure was also his apparent lack of authority, and the German says there is something to the observations. ""I was always the assistant coach, and the assistant coach is always the good guy and the coach the bad guy. ""I'm also not the kind of guy who has too much authority. I'm 180cm and 70kg, so if TaZ is standing behind you, he just has more authority as well. I was always the good guy, and it's just not a personal trait I have. G2 tried to change me with mental guys, but it's really hard to change your personality."" Toward the end of Swani's stint in the team, G2 enacted one of the more controversial roster changes in recent times by swapping Justin ""jks"" Savage for Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković. ""Justin is the type of guy that is more quiet, and you sometimes need to pull everything out of him. It's hard in a team dynamic where you travel so much and have to be transparent with each other, and you don't improve as a team if not everyone is giving their opinion. ""peca also said that he would get visibly frustrated on camera, and a player like huNter- gets easily affected by this. It was just a team thing where we felt like we hit the ceiling, so we needed to make a change, and the change was to have better communication from our lurk,"" he said while ending the answer by reiterating that he feels that the decision was the correct one. Editor's note: The interview was conducted prior to nexa's benching. Swani eventually stepped down from G2 at the end of 2023 and retired in April 2024, bringing an end to a very successful and unusual career. ""When I was lying in bed, I was asking myself if I really wanted this. It got to 'no' and then back to 'yes.' All my career I was analyzing CS:GO, and had a lot of issues adapting to CS2, finding new stuff and tricks that you do with the smoke. I'm not a fan of building your game plan around random stuff, which took away some of the fun for me,"" he said about the decision. Despite all this, Swani finished the interview by stating that his love of the game has not waned, but that he doesn't want the stress of having to perform and travel, and that he intends to remain in esports.",4-7-2024 21:06,1720119960000
Esports World Cup opening matchups revealed,https://www.hltv.org/news/39346/esports-world-cup-opening-matchups-revealed,"G2's brand new roster will take on The Mongolz in the highlight game of the opening round. The opening matchups have been announced for Esports World Cup, which is set to take place July 17-21 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 15 teams are set to battle it out for their share of a $1,000,000 prize pool, with $400,000 of that set aside for the eventual winner. Winners of the opening round Bo3 bouts will head straight to the playoffs, whilst the losers fall to the ""resurrection stage"" to join JiJieHao. The resurrection stage will feature a straightforward Bo1 single elimination bracket, with the winner taking the final playoff spot. Bo3 play will recommence for the playoffs, where a single elimination bracket will decide the tournament winner. The most fascinating matchup of the opening round will see the new-look G2 squad take on The MongolZ. A household name who will be in the midst of embedding two new players whilst trying to figure numerous role clashes, taking on one of the hottest rising squads of the previous season. Virtus.pro vs. Complexity serves as the other headline matchup as it is one of the hardest to call. The two teams are virtually side by side in the world rankings, both have shown moments of promise and moments of weakness in recent times, and Complexity took Virtus.pro down in the quarter-finals of ESL Pro League, meaning the Russian squad have the chance to exact some revenge.

Community reacts: Snax signs for G2,https://www.hltv.org/news/39343/community-reacts-snax-signs-for-g2,"There has not been much love from the community for G2's left field signing of the Polish legend. G2 commenced a revamp of their squad during this off-season, and it was a revamp many in the community felt was needed. The much-maligned Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković and Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen were moved to the bench, the former making room for hot prospect Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa. Speculation was rife as to how G2 was going to resolve the IGL position. Plenty expected Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač to move into the role, but instead G2 threw the community a spectacular curveball by bringing Polish legend Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski into the lineup. In general the reaction to the move has been negative. Much of the negativity surrounding Snax's introduction to G2 is centered on the numerous role clashes that the team will have to solve ahead of the new season. Another common theme that has cropped up in the reactions to Snax's addition is the expectation that, after a honeymoon period, G2's form would drop off and the team would not be successful in the long term. There does, however, seem to be some degree of excitement or at least curiosity as to how the reunion of Snax and Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas will work out. It's not all been doom and gloom from the community. Some of the more positive reactions have suggested that this move was better than the alternatives and that Snax has more to offer as an IGL than some give him credit for. And some people just wanted to wish their ex-teammate well.",4-7-2024 23:00,1720126800000
Sources: Liquid target Polish AWPer ultimate,https://www.hltv.org/news/39347/sources-liquid-target-polish-awper-ultimate,"Liquid turn to an off-the-radar AWPer in their latest rebuild. Liquid have set their sights on Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak as their new AWPer, several sources with knowledge of the move have revealed to HLTV.org. The 20-year-old Pole is expected to be one of three new additions to the team in the summer off-season. Coach Wilton ""zews"" Prado and AWPer and in-game leader Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller were removed last month, while Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros is reportedly joining FURIA. ultimate parted ways with Illuminar last week following a three-month spell with the Polish squad. Before that, he also played short stints under NOM, PGE Turow and AGO dating back to 2022. Though his early years left much to be desired, in Counter-Strike 2 the AWPer seems to have found his stride with a 1.16 average rating and 1.24 Impact playing mostly against sub-top-50 opposition in various European tournaments. His call-up from Liquid comes as a complete surprise, especially given the organization's focus on bigger names in their latest rebuild late last year. It seems that the current state of the market has caused them to shift towards unproven talent, as one source indicated other options came with a hefty price tag.",4-7-2024 22:21,1720124460000
Monte parts ways with Woro2k,https://www.hltv.org/news/39348/monte-parts-ways-with-woro2k,"The Ukrainian AWPer departs his home of nearly two years. Monte has announced the benching of AWPer and IGL Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk, ending a near two-year stint on the team for one of its founding members. This marks the latest in a string of changes for Monte in recent times, as they only just brought Martin ""STYKO"" Styk and Ali ""hAdji"" Haïnouss into the lineup. Monte did not reveal who would be replacing Woro2k on the team, but a post the team recently made on X seemed to suggest they had a replacement lined up and that there would be further changes. Woro2k's destination is as of yet unclear. The player seemed to make a veiled reference on X to having already signed with a new team mere days ago, but whether or not this is true remains to be seen. The 22-year-old sniper was one of the founding members of Monte and served as the team's IGL for much of his near two-year stint. They garnered some modest success in the online scene in 2022 after their founding in July, but suffered from roster instability. With the arrival of Szymon ""kRaSnaL"" Mrozek, Viktor ""sdy"" Orudzhev and Sergey ""lmbt"" Bezhanov by January of 2023, Monte began their climb proper. They began to rise through the world rankings amidst a number of online event wins, the most impressive coming in ESL Challenger League, and qualified for the BLAST Paris Major Europe RMR. The team continued their spectacular rise by making an underdog run to top-eight at the Paris Major, which saw them claim a spot in the top 10 of the world ranking. Soon after said Major run Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas departed the team and many expected Monte to drop off, but with their ranks bolstered by Alexander ""br0"" Bro they continued to perform at a high level. They claimed a top-four finish at ESL Pro League S18, second-place at Roobet Cup 2023, and the trophy at ESL Challenger Jönköping 2023 to cement their status as a near-top-five team by the end of 2023. The departures of br0 and sdy early in 2024 seriously hampered Monte, and the squad began to slide down the world ranking. They still enjoyed a couple of deep runs in tier-two online events, but results had taken a significant hit overall. With Woro2k's departure, Monte are now left without a single member of the original roster. Sergiy ""DemQQ"" Demchenko is the longest-serving player remaining, as he replaced Karol ""rallen"" Rodowicz on the team a mere week after its founding. Monte are now: Martin ""STYKO"" Styk Ali ""hAdji"" Haïnouss (stand-in) Sergiy ""DemQQ"" Demchenko Szymon ""kRaSnaL"" Mrozek Sergey ""lmbt"" Bezhanov (coach)",5-7-2024 13:08,1720177680000

GamerLegion have announced the signing of Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson from Metizport to fill the IGL void left by Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski's recent departure to G2. The move marks the organization's fourth roster change in three months, with Sebastian ""volt"" Maloș now the only member of GamerLegion's Copenhagen Major roster. ztr was benched by Metizport in May, less than two months after reaching the semi-finals of the BLAST Premier Spring Showdown with the team by battling past Falcons and Monte. ztr comes into GamerLegion as a replacement for Snax, who is 11 years older than the Swede. The team now has an average age of 19.8, with The MongolZ currently the only other top 30 team with an average under 20 years.

Editorial: Tier-one Counter-Strike rosters are judged too harshly,https://www.hltv.org/news/39331/editorial-tier-one-counter-strike-rosters-are-judged-too-harshly,"Winning is vitally important in any competitive endeavour, but the top rosters in CS get a raw deal from the community. The CS community's favorite pastime is casting judgment, and there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone loves to throw their opinion around on a player, team, tournament, and caster, letting everyone know what they think and how they judge things to be. It's part and parcel of esports and it's part of what makes it so much fun to be a fan. Anyone can have an opinion and discuss and debate that opinion with other enthusiasts. Top teams are particular hotspots for fan opinion, and understandably so. They compete for trophies and glory and are the most visible teams in the scene, appearing at all of the top tournaments and usually in the playoffs, thus in arenas full of fans. These rosters are prone to incredibly harsh treatment by the community. The opinions seem to trend towards the negative, and whilst this may be a vocal minority, few would argue that hating on particular rosters is a preferred pastime for plenty of fans. These harshly negative opinions are often simply too harsh. Fair analysis and criticism are eschewed in favor of supporting the prevailing narratives. Rosters are burdened by unrealistic expectations, and their successes are often dismissed because of this. Lineups are given precious little time to find their feet and will be lambasted after very few events if they don't hit the ground running. Top rosters simply get the short end of the stick, and a few themes in the extreme criticism directed at these rosters crop up repeatedly, with almost everyone getting blasted at one point or another. The first recurring theme in the CS community's take on roster success is that the focus is either sharply directed at whatever tournament happens to be going on that week, and the wider context is ignored or minimized, or teams are not given credit for a strong performance based on their wider tournament showings. The goalposts shift depending on the team and the narrative surrounding said team. Take MOUZ and Natus Vincere as two recent examples. In the case of MOUZ, their stellar run of one second place and two trophies in as many tournaments was almost completely forgotten in the midst of their failure at IEM Dallas. For Natus Vincere, their historic victory in the first CS2 Major was diminished as being a fluke run at the time, based on the wider context of their struggles outside of said Major. The goalposts are moved to suit the narrative the community seems to favor at the time. MOUZ are a relatively popular team, but the overriding perception that they are studio merchants and chokers on stage meant the community was frothing at the bit to leap upon their failure to carry their earlier success into an arena LAN. Natus Vincere's current roster sports some popular targets for the community's ire, like Mihai ""iM"" Ivan and Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen, so any excuse to downplay their Major run was grasped upon instantly. How much attention is paid to the fact that MOUZ are an incredibly young roster, that they are moving steadily in the right direction, and that their Dallas performance came after a long stretch of near-constant competitive play that took its toll on them mentally? How much credit were Natus Vincere given for finding ways to clinch tight maps consistently, or for recovering from being relatively handily beaten by Spirit and Cloud9 back-to-back during their Major run? The popular narrative was seemingly more important than considering all the context. Of course, the context that MOUZ are better in studio games and Natus Vincere played above their usual level at the Major cannot be ignored. However, the simple fact is that the community amplified or disregarded the context that suited the popular narrative rather than applying any consistent criteria for judging these two rosters and their success. It probably shouldn't be surprising, but there is a tendency to set wildly unrealistic expectations of rosters based on the personnel involved. Of course a roster's projected returns should be based upon the tools they have at their disposal, but the expectations seem disconnected from reality when it comes to the top teams. Take G2. There can be no doubt they have two of the very best players in the game right now among their number, namely Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač. Over the last 18 months the organization has seen a good return from their current roster, with consistent playoff appearances, two of the biggest trophies on offer in the form of Katowice and Cologne, and a Major top-four under their belts. Yet somehow, G2 may very well have been the most-criticized roster in the upper echelons of the scene during that time. Yes, G2 is the home of NiKo and m0NESY, but the roster is not particularly stacked when compared to other top teams. Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač is solid, provides the odd impressive peak, but is somewhere in the 1.10 region for rating across his tier one career. Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen was a low-fragging IGL. Neither Justin ""jks"" Savage nor Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković were going to set the server alight. Realistically, if you actually examine what G2 have been working with, does three trophies, constant top-fours and playoff appearances, and the odd disappointing low-point, represent such a terrible record? m0NESY seems to think so, and G2 as an org clearly decided the roster was not achieving the desired results, but was the harsh judgment of their previous core really fair? Natus Vincere are another prime example. What superstar, or even consistent star-level, player do Natus Vincere have on the roster? Where is the tier one experience beyond Aleksib and Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy? Yet the way Natus Vincere are discussed, you'd think their Major victory, second-place finishes at EPL and BLAST Spring Final, and regular playoff appearances are worthless. If Natus Vincere's roster is as bad as many in the community make out, why aren't we mightily impressed with their record? One could potentially argue that the expectations are based partly upon the name value of the organization. A fair point, but how relevant is that when examining the success of a given roster? If Natus Vincere don't have the personnel to match their iconic Major-winning lineup, and if G2 have a roster about as stacked for talent as those around them, why are we inflating our expectations so much? An absolute classic among all esports communities, not just CS's, is to give rosters about five minutes to become the greatest team of all time or they suck. It takes two to three events tops before the community checks out of any given roster, and there are innumerable examples of such an attitude in recent times. Natus Vincere were already getting slated after only a few showings with their European roster after it came together mid-way through last year, and most people had given up on the lineup achieving anything by the end of the year. G2 were given a single online event with nexa before the wolves descended upon them late last year. Liquid put together a truly international roster of disparate elements, yet were written off after a couple of qualifiers before they got the chance to get their revamped roster onto the same page. You can debate whether or not the reaction turned out to be justified further down the line with any of the three lineups mentioned, but the fact is the teams were definitively judged far too early. It took Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's ENCE squad a long time to ramp up prior to their IEM Fall 2021 breakout, MOUZ have been nurturing their current lineup for a period dating back to their WePlay Academy League days, and it took Eternal Fire's current roster many months work their way to a tier-one level. Rosters are simply given too little time to simmer, and defining narratives are served up far before we can be sure they really apply. Anyone who has watched CS for some time will remember the era-defining teams of the past. Ninjas in Pyjamas at the very birth of CS:GO, fnatic, the Brazilians across the SK and Luminosity days, and the most dominant team of all time, Astralis. For much of CS:GO's history the peak of success was a plethora of tournament wins across an entire year, multiple Major trophies, and years of the game defined by a single roster. Now, times have changed. The scene has strengthened and deepened, there are more elite and world-class players to pick from, and there are a number of teams at the top with the resources required to put together a strong roster supported by a professional backroom staff. Even the potent Natus Vincere and FaZe rosters of recent times could not match the level of dominance displayed by the previously mentioned powerhouses. Even if you are jostling for the No. 1 spot, success simply cannot be defined in the same way anymore. Those who watched the game during Astralis' dominance and prior had their expectations of what the best teams should expect to achieve moulded by the era-defining rosters, and those who started watching in more recent times have been handed down this paradigm. We need to accept that now, G2's Katowice and Cologne double in 2023 should be considered a highly successful year. Natus Vincere's year so far should be considered a success, with a Major trophy and Big Event final already under their belts. MOUZ's second-place arena LAN finish and superlative run through ESL Pro League and BetBoom Dacha should be celebrated rather than diminished. We can't hold on to the old metrics for what the best teams in the world should achieve.",5-7-2024 20:14,1720203240000
"HooXi interview: Benching, dealing with criticism, and post-G2 future",https://www.hltv.org/news/39351/hooxi-interview-benching-dealing-with-criticism-and-post-g2-future,"The Danish captain sat down with HLTV to discuss his time with G2 and what lies ahead for him. In one of the largest overhauls of the player break so far, G2 announced the benching of in-game leader Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen nearly one week ago, putting an end to a nearly two-year-long tenure for the Dane in the international side's ranks. HooXi helped his team to secure the prestigious IEM Katowice and IEM Cologne titles in 2023, but G2 struggled to find further victories elsewhere, leading to a significant amount of criticism being heaped upon the captain. The European side's recent campaign in IEM Dallas added further fuel to the fire, as G2 hoisted the trophy with Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip in lieu of HooXi, suggesting to fans that the team was capable of claiming wins without their current leader on the server. Shortly after his official move to G2's bench, HooXi spoke with HLTV at length regarding a wide range of topics, sharing details of his two years with the team, discussing the additions of Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski, and what the Dane's hopes and plans for the future are. When you were told that you were getting benched and put up for sale, what was the primary feeling? Sadness? Relief in a way, perhaps? The immediate feeling was definitely disappointment. In London, I got told that they were exploring other options but that nothing was set in stone, so I had been sitting with a slight hope of staying, especially since the decision dragged out for so long. The announcement of your benching came several days after nexa was removed from the team; by then, it had been reported that G2 were looking to sign malbsMd. Was there a world in which you continued on the team? Were you involved in the planning of the squad for the upcoming season at all? Were you consulted on the malbsMd signing? From what I was told, there was a chance I would keep my spot. I was asked for my opinion on nexa. But besides that, no. As you watched the team win the IEM Dallas trophy without you, what was on your mind? Did you think, 'I might be in trouble'? I was thinking of one thing, and that was to help the guys as much as possible to get the best result. Coming up to the tournament and during most of it, I was working as hard as usual. Some would say it was like digging my own grave, but when I am on a team, and especially for this long, they become family to me and I don’t put myself before that. What are your thoughts on your replacement, Snax? He has a lot of experience as a player (not so much as a captain) and represents a firepower upgrade. But given that he's fairly new to the role, how do you think the team will fare? I don’t know much about Snax as a leader, but him being Polish might create a good dynamic between TaZ and Snax to get off to a good start. I also think it’s going to be tough to analyze the changes individually since malbsMd for nexa is also a big change. With malbsMd coming in to replace nexa, one of the main talking points is the potential role clash. Is that a concern that you share? I haven’t talked to the team about malbsMd or to malbsMd himself at all. I don’t know their plans at all, but I doubt G2 would sign someone with the same roles as Nemanja without dealing with that issue first. How would you describe your time with G2? Is there anything you regret or wish you had done differently? Maybe the Major veto? My time in G2 has been a rollercoaster ride in a lot of ways. I don’t really regret anything because I have been giving it my all for two years and I have done what I thought was the best to do in the moments when I was in them. I wish I would’ve done better in a lot of areas looking back at it, but it’s not with a feeling of regret. The cost is losses and, in the end, my spot, and the gain are learning and experience. Do you think things would have been different if you had won the Major in Copenhagen? Without a doubt. That is why Majors are so special, they write the script until the next one comes around. There's this narrative that you couldn't properly set up NiKo and m0NESY as a captain and that the team's win in Dallas proved that. What are your thoughts on that? There is? I’ve never heard that before. A guy like NiKo is very easy to work with in the sense that he will come to you with suggestions and ideas and you just kind of have to pick and choose, and it’s more a partnership than a one-way street of me setting him up for success. For Ilya, it’s also pretty easy but in a different way. You just have to unleash him. If you put a player like that into a strict system with chains on him he will still be good but not great. I think that, as he grows and gets older, he will start to take more responsibility, and maybe the fact that we are speaking English is also holding him back a bit. Now that this chapter of your career is closed, how do you look at all the criticism leveled at you? Do you feel that you were unfairly targeted at times? How did all this negative attention impact you, inside and outside the game? I think the amount of criticism at times has been fair, but I also think it became a trend to hate me sometimes. I think I have been on par with a lot of the other IGLs individually in CS2, with roles and playstyle taken into consideration, and I don’t think my level was a huge issue on this team. And I think I was improving a bit until EPL, but after that it was obviously tough to show more. I realized after winning the World Final, getting first in the BLAST group stage and winning IEM Katowice that if I didn’t get some recognition from this period, then I would never get it, and the general view was that this team would have done the same with any IGL. After that, I stopped taking opinions from the outside too seriously. The community has this perception that G2 is NiKo's team and that everything that happens goes through him. But from what I was told, he was actually one of your biggest supporters. Is that assessment accurate? Can you reveal what he told you after your benching? I hope everyone understands that the whole “NiKo CEO” thing is the biggest meme. He gets to voice his opinion and he is by nature not a guy who just leans back and says nothing. But there’s a huge difference between being able to voice your thoughts and them becoming reality. So to answer your question, that assessment is ridiculous. I talked with him (and everyone else on the team individually) after I got the news in London. While I got some feedback I never really heard anything that would be bench feedback worthy. I wanted to ask you about Stewie2K's comments about some of the issues he came across while playing for the team. He said that some of the players didn't seem to respect TaZ too much and that it was a tense atmosphere where players didn't openly talk about the issues at hand. Did you feel this, too? The issue of not talking openly on the team has been a problem since the day I joined the team. I tried to push for some team talks and encourage everyone to speak up freely, but it was never really a high priority, unfortunately. In the end, this issue also played a big part in me being benched, I assume. For Wiktor, I think everyone respects him. As a person, he is great, and with the career he had as a player, he is a living legend. As a coach, he is new, though. I was very happily surprised with him at the start, but at some point, I think his priorities switched a bit in the team and we never really came back on track. This is something I really wish I could be a part of. Talking about your future: what sort of team are you looking for? Do you think you'll find a new team fairly quickly, or is there a chance you'll wait a bit and see what happens? Because your benching was announced quite late in the off-season… I think it will be really tough to find a new team immediately as the decision from G2 came this late. I’ll try to look at it as an opportunity to work on myself, both in-game and outside the game, since it’s hard to have a good balance in life, especially as an IGL, at least in the way I’ve been doing things until now. Are you open to the possibility of joining a team that is a level below G2? One that is not inside the top 10 or challenging for trophies. My biggest priority is to win and to do well in CS. I can’t say if I will be able to pick and choose, but I have been benched once before and that was one step backward and five forward. What are you looking for in your next project? I have some key values that are very important to me as a person and player, and I’m hoping to find a team that shares these values with me. Not to say that I didn’t have any of this in G2, but this is what I believe it takes for me to show my best self in the future. I’m looking for a team where hard work, honesty, and sacrifice for the team are top priorities. I think every teammate I’ve ever had can attest to the amount of work I put in, and I’m always looking to improve the team. When you get an entire team with that same mindset, some amazing things can happen. When it comes to style, my goal is to mix my preferred playstyle with the strengths of the players I’d be playing with. I prefer a loose playstyle, with a lot of responsibility on the individuals. The goal is to get everyone on the same page in terms of how to react to situations, so everyone is comfortable taking initiative. But again, to achieve that you need a full team of people giving it their all, every day. So to boil it down, the most important thing is probably to find a team as hungry as me, with high ambitions. I have so much more to prove. What do you think you still have left to achieve? I have so much left still, I have hardly begun. The highest highs a CS team can reach on paper are winning a Major and a Grand Slam. For me, there are also a bunch of individual goals, so there are a lot of motivators for me. Hopefully, I will get to show that as soon as possible.",6-7-2024 19:21,1720286460000
BLEED add nexa for faveN,https://www.hltv.org/news/39337/bleed-add-nexa-for-faven,"kassad has moved swiftly to sign his compatriot from G2's bench. BLEED have announced the addition of Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković in a transfer from G2, confirming a 28 June report from Sheep Esports. The Serbian anchor replaces Josef ""faveN"" Baumann in the starting lineup, leaving just Hampus ""hampus"" Poser and Cai ""CYPHER"" Watson from the original five-man squad BLEED entered Counter-Strike with just six months ago. Coach and general manager Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović has not been afraid of ruthless moves when opportunities arise on the market. That was apparent in their double swoop for Joakim ""jkaem"" Myrbostad and Tim ""nawwk"" Jonasson from Apeks, and the same attitude is behind this move after nexa was benched by G2. nexa came under criticism in his second stint at G2, where he replaced Justin ""jks"" Savage and averaged a 0.98 rating in Big Events, but he still has the faith of the coach that gave him his international debut with Renegades in 2017. With hampus as in-game leader, nexa will also be free to continue in his preferred lurker-anchor roles without any captaincy responsibilities. faveN, who nexa will replace, struggled to adapt to new roles after jkaem's signing and averaged a 0.81 rating in his last three events with the team. The more naturally supportive nexa will now take up that mantle, as BLEED enter the new season with a clear goal of qualifying for the Shanghai Major on the organization's home continent.

In an hour-long appearance on a Dust2.dk podcast released on Wednesday, TSM coach Allan ""Rejin"" Petersen revealed new details about discussions that took place behind the scenes around his team's shift towards an all-Danish lineup. The organization ended up signing Frederik ""acoR"" Gyldstrand, Nikolaj ""niko"" Kristensen and Alexander ""Altekz"" Givskov, but according to the coach TSM were close to landing Benjamin ""blameF"" Bremer and Kristian ""k0nfig"" Wienecke for the last two positions instead. The move would have seen the former Complexity and Astralis teammates reunited, but fell apart in the end after blameF decided to take the other offer he had on the table, from fnatic. ""We talked with Astralis about blameF to try to get him on board. As far as I understand, the contract was already accepted by blameF's side with regards to TSM, and the buyout was also okay,"" Rejin said on the podcast. ""blameF had also been honest all along and said that he was not sure whether it should be one way or the other, as he had another offer, which turned out to be fnatic,"" the coach continued. ""We also had k0nfig involved in that context, who was supposed to be the last player, and everything was also in place with the buyout from NIP and so on. He wanted to wait because of the blameF situation, which I could understand."" k0nfig has been sitting on Ninjas in Pyjamas's bench since February.

Editorial: Will Stewie2K find redemption?,https://www.hltv.org/news/39333/editorial-will-stewie2k-find-redemption,"Is redemption possible for Stewie2K in the off-season following a darling run at IEM Dallas? The statistician lives in a Hell of his own making. Obsessed with precision, he endlessly throws up parameters that become his conscious cage. Hounded by finality, he lives by the dusty achievements of the past and the VLOOKUPs of today. Chasing the absolute, he is confounded by the mysteries of faith, or rather, by the intangibles of life. Entropy is his enemy, ever seeking him and his models, throwing the floorboards out from under them, and leaving naught but ruins behind. All of us, to some degree, try to insulate ourselves from the vicissitudes of life. We throw up worldviews, belief systems, and rankings, all in the hope that they signify value. But the universal ferment that bubbles beneath the surface dogs us further. Intangibles haunt us ever on. And while cold, engineered precision has brought us the modern creature comforts that we all know today, the fires of competition do not play by the laws of ""optimal"" or ""exact."" Sometimes chaos rains from the sky, and it is this quantum uncertainty that drives the statistician into a frenzy. This brings us to today’s column: Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip’s miracle run with G2 at IEM Dallas. G2’s victory in Dallas with the Stewie2K flavor reinvigorated the scene, in particular injecting much-needed lifeblood into the giant consumer market that is North America. It surprised nearly everyone who observes and commentates on professional CS, and was truly Cinderella-like in how ""GStew"" overcame numerous higher-ranked teams to claw their way to a gold medal. Just how was this feat accomplished with a stand-in — particularly one who hadn’t (mostly) played high-level CS in two years and stood on a playoffs stage in five? What made this stand-in such a draw in terms of eyeballs and storylines? What could this signify about Stewie2K’s future? Mount Stew On paper, the deciding factors for G2’s ridiculous tournament run are relatively clear. A monstrous performance from Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov wowed crowds and teammates alike. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, now long in the tooth in terms of tilt, took on the IGL mantle and seemed completely at ease with it, and also threw up massive numbers in the fragging department. And finally, we saw vestiges of Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač’s form from late CS:GO, as the cousin made game-changing plays and had his fair share of large moments. These are the players in the G2 core who have to be unlocked to make deep tournament runs. However, something throughout 2024 had seemed off; the entire team seemed rigid and afraid, and fell short of expectations for such a stacked fragging core. Outside of 3-4th place finishes at IEM Chengdu 2024 and the PGL Copenhagen Major, their results gravitated more in the 5th-8th place finishes range, far from both internal and external expectations. Lo! Enter Stewie2K. Firstly, from the statistics perspective, both Stewie2K and Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković had generally poor showings in Dallas. But something about the former completely reinvigorated G2 compared to earlier. A vibe in the air gave G2 a super-charged, can-do energy. The kids, and Stewie2K himself, called it an “aura,” and perhaps there is a semblance of truth here. And while it was easy to laugh off Stewie2K’s jittery spray, his missed smokes on Nuke, or his lack of confidence sometimes, at other times his impact in unlocking m0NESY and NiKo was clear. Selfless, brash, and determined play by Stewie2K set G2 on a victory course that charted through a hard-fought campaign against MOUZ, Liquid, FaZe, 9z, and Vitality to a brutally fought tournament victory. And my oh my were the games thrilling, close, and scrappy. An homage to days of less clinical Counter-Strike that hooked us all. Why does it matter? For the statistician and the spreadsheeteer, stand-ins are correctly noted as being a downgrade most of the time. The history of CS is replete with the use of stand-ins at tournaments, as visa issues, sicknesses, and family events have invariably worked their toll on the ability of all five players to attend an event. And outside of a few notable examples, such as Justin ""jks"" Savage standing-in for FaZe at IEM Katowice 2022 to win the entire event in a triple overtime thriller, they tend to flop in performance output. In baseball (European readers are allowed to cover their eyes here), sabermetrics refers to an analytical approach to the game that relies on statistics to measure in-game activity. In the world of esports, this kind of approach is presupposed by the nature of the very medium, but to continue the analogy, sabermetrics is an entirely different approach to a sport that simultaneously kills some of its fun. We live in a world of uncertainty, of messy humans and messier competitions.  The addition of Stewie2K into G2’s starting five in place of beleaguered (now benched) IGL Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen for IEM Dallas slotted him into the role of a much needed, if individually underwhelming, designated hitter (to slightly further the baseball analogy) for the team. He was in the right place at the right time to make some individual plays that then unlocked his teammates. This was a certain factor in G2’s success, primarily in finding breathing room to let their skills shine and dominate the server at the expense of their opponents. Like so many other sports, and in particular ones with single participants or small teams, e.g. tennis, basketball, and CS, the mental aspect is a huge factor in team performance. One overly relaxed flow state later and a good player can easily find themselves standing perched on a podium, wondering how they arrived through a haze of glory. On the other hand, one bad premonition, one taste of bad blood in the team, or even one bad sleep schedule can quickly send champions tumbling back to earth, despite all their practice and mental fortitude. Statisticians, of course, hate this. There is no room in the world of rankings and ADR for aura, or vibes, or intangibles. The very concept that a stand-in can be snatched piecemeal off the streets of San Francisco, pulled through the vape-pen fumes of 4AM FACEIT queues, and be used to revive an erstwhile dying roster is anathema to the world of the statistician. And while a simple eye test of Stewie2K showed he did not have the sufficient aim, spray control, or decision making of a tier one pro in 2024, he somehow managed to continually have an impact in G2’s matches as well as on their mental overall. Over-contrived comments about storylines and aura aside, there is something to be said for the fact that it has been Stewie2K who has pulled three fairytale runs out of the hat in his CS career, and come to define the region itself. Whether it is the mocking eye of God peering at us from the sky, or the indelible streams of entropy moving history in one particular direction, it seems that Stewie2K has figured out the art of being in the right place at the right time. And that skill has saddled him with winners’ trophies and medals, something his detractors generally cannot be said to possess. Past, Present, and Stewture: What Next? There is pristine but sterile CS (old Astralis and current MOUZ come to mind), and then there is messy but dynamic CS. The former almost always wins. But we are far more likely to remember the latter (and content-brained Americans rejoice as a result). Stewie2K’s run with G2 took us back to the early CS:GO days when tournaments were free-for-alls and volatile matches were a given, and while this will not be a longtime trend, it was good to be reminded of the existence of that side of the game. It brought back many old fans and reenergized many new spectators. But will Stewie2K be able to run with this hypercharged momentum and find himself back in the world of top tier Counter-Strike again? It’s hard to say for sure as the outspoken American certainly has a high estimation of his own ability and tends to ruffle feathers within an already anemic and insular American scene. In a recent interview with Alex ""Mauisnake"" Ellenberg on his stream, Stewie2K seemed confident that he would return in some capacity and relatively soon. But in that same interview, Stewie2K couldn’t help but spill the tea quite extensively on G2’s internal issues and awkward leaderless environment. This openness, or perhaps call it obliviousness, certainly rubbed many readers and community members the wrong way, and suffice to say we at the least should not expect the American to be invited to join G2’s current four-man roster in the near future. It is his very tendency to be heedless and bold that has both propelled him to boundless success in CS, but also contributed to his very own downfall during the waning Liquid days in 2019 and subsequent disastrous (and infamous) stint on Evil Geniuses. In a way, Stewie2K is still climbing out of a hole he dug back then, and while the Dallas run is certainly a large leg up, he will need to keep climbing. Life is brutal with accountability for one's past like that. It is also nearly certain that a phenomenon like Stewie2K’s IEM Dallas run won’t come around for a long time; it is a statistical outlier on an X-Y axis that lives on an island all of its own. After all, sport is a tough and remorseless arena. Outliers are quickly squashed or countered, and one trick ponies go by that name because when you shock your opponent with novelty, their adaptation comes ever faster. Going beyond the delicate balance of a competitive dance into the world of all-out frenzy opens up a player to self-implosion. A 1970s tennis writer once exclaimed, “His winners look like they should count for two points,” when watching Jimmy Connors play in the Wimbledon final. We don’t get two points for a faster serve, nor do we get two rounds added to the scoreboard off the back of an instrumental game-winning clutch. Stewie2K will not get an extra two points added to the scoreboard for his clutches or aura, even if they may explosively result in tournament-bending results from time to time. Whether we like it or not, we are hemmed in by the parameters and brackets that statisticians throw at us, kept to a fixed range in any direction we seek — a sort of observable universe of potential where we are located directly in the referential center. And as much as the statisticians are hounded by unpredictability and unforeseen consequences, so we too are kept fixed in place by medians and means. Thus, we shouldn’t expect Stewie2K to overshoot his average median any time soon, at least without putting in a lot more work to modernize his play, something he alluded to in his Mauisnake interview. Slots in tier-one teams are limited, and not many free ones come walking along. As entertaining as Stewie2K’s brief resurgence in the limelight was, and as likely as it is that he will emerge in some capacity somewhere again, the law of medians will prevail. So, by all means, you can expect that the next title will be claimed by the five most aura-free, yet professional, Europeans you’ve ever laid eyes upon.",7-7-2024 14:01,1720353660000
ash interview: Hardship after Paris Major and GamerLegion's bet on youth in latest overhaul,https://www.hltv.org/news/39352/ash-interview-hardship-after-paris-major-and-gamerlegions-bet-on-youth-in-latest-overhaul,"The British coach spoke to HLTV about GamerLegion's struggles after their Paris Major roster was pulled apart and the team's bet on youth in this off-season. GamerLegion have had a turbulent history ever since they entered Counter-Strike in 2019, having been represented by 27 players across this period. Rebuilds have been a regular occurrence during GamerLegion's transfer windows, as the team slowly rose up the ranks to assemble the Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek-led roster that would go on to reach the final of the Paris Major under the tutelage of long-term coach Ashley ""ash"" Battye. Their success was a double-edged sword, however. The team was torn apart as siuhy and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan were signed by MOUZ and Natus Vincere, respectively, and GamerLegion were thrust into yet another rebuild after a result that was supposed to catapult them into the realms of tier-one competition. ash, who had been in the organization for almost three years at that point, was tasked with constructing a new roster that would capitalize on their Major result, but the endeavor proved to be much harder than anticipated. The organization couldn't secure any of its top targets — a result of community perception, according to the coach — which resulted in a mishmash team that only lasted until the latest summer break. GamerLegion have now assembled a young and hungry team that, if able to reach its potential under the leadership of ash, could return the organization to the upper echelons of Counter-Strike. The 33-year-old has become synonymous with the GamerLegion brand in recent years, but his start in the German organization in 2020 was quite unorthodox. ""I was looking for a job and sent their manager a message offering help with analysis and work for a few months for free,"" he recalls. ""But after a month, Gux GamerLegion's coach at the time said to me that he thinks I'm a better coach than him, so he took a job elsewhere and moved away from esports. It was a bit of initiative and a bit of good fortune."" His role and responsibility grew over the coming years, but scouting was something the Brit has been passionate about from the get-go, and that proved invaluable across the countless signings the organization made during his tenure. ""I've always been the person that scouts the hardest and pushes for who to get. I prioritize who we should go for, and the organization tries to make it work,"" ash began. ""That comes from watching a lot of demos, having opinions from people, talking with them in meetings, and going through a lot of statistics. GamerLegion also know they probably don't have the best insight on this, so they trust the coaching staff, which worked out pretty well so far. I have a massive part in the scouting, but it's a team effort."" The first few years at the helm of the team saw steady progress as GamerLegion climbed to their peak of No. 20 in the world rankings at the end of 2022 after the signings of siuhy, Frederik ""acoR"" Gyldstrand, and Nicolas ""Keoz"" Dgus, but no one could foresee their breakout at the last CS:GO Major in Paris. siuhy and company started the opening stage with a 0-2 record, but fought back from the brink of elimination to make it to the playoffs in Paris. Even then, no one expected much from the plucky underdogs, but the European combine fought through Monte and HEROIC to set up a trophy clash against Vitality, where their fairytale run ended. ""It's just a really nice memory,"" ash reminisces about the tournament. ""Sometimes you just leave everything in the past and don't enjoy the best moments. Losing the final was sad and felt like a failure at the time, but we eventually agreed it was an amazing achievement. We really believed we could win the Major because we looked at the rest of the scene and thought it didn't look very strong. ""My regret from the final is that we never got to play together again. Having the opportunity to go out and prove ourselves is something I regret because I feel like we had everything."" While he was entirely focused on the Major, the thought of being unable to keep the roster together crossed his mind several times during the tournament, ash admits. ""That's why it was so sad after we lost. You usually think a team that did this well would be happy and proud of themselves. We were, but the main thought was that we might not get a chance with this team ever again. You just don't know if you're losing one, two, or five people."" Soon after the Major, iM and siuhy made the jump up to Natus Vincere and MOUZ respectively, and the team broke up as quickly as it found success. ""I was still motivated, but I think the rest of the team was demotivated and demoralized. It wasn't just that we nearly won the tournament but that we felt that we progressed so much, and then for some reason, the community opinion was that we got hard-carried. The storyline just kept changing, and then at the end, it felt like nobody wanted to join us."" The community perception forced the team to throw roles out of the window by signing Sebastian ""volt"" Maloș and Sanzhar ""neaLaN"" Iskhakov. ""I had a list of 18 replacements for iM, and volt was the 19th choice because he didn't fit any roles at all. He wasn't even on that list, he's just a player I admired,"" the Brit says. ""We also couldn't get any in-game leaders we wanted, and I think the public opinion on us was so low that we just had to dive into other options, which probably demotivated everyone even more. You just hope to drop down a bit and come back again, but it felt like we just lost everything. We had to start all over again because we didn't get anyone we wanted."" It was therefore not much of a surprise when neaLaN got removed just three events into his tenure, but ash reiterates that the removal wasn't all on the Kazakh IGL. ""It wasn't really neaLaN's fault, it was the team's direction. It felt like nealaN had a real clear vision of playing, but for the players we had, it just didn't fit at all."" GamerLegion were then tasked with filling the IGL void once again, and the organization took a risk in signing Polish veteran Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski. ""The roles were still a mess, and I thought the best way to combat this was to be a bit different. Snax is quite a puggy caller, he doesn't need time to throw a system together and just feels how the opposition is playing. That's his biggest strength, just making slight adjustments and going in where he finds a weakness."" As with their previous moves, Snax's signing didn't go according to plan, as Valve released CS2 just as the Pole signed the contract. ""That was a little bit of a disaster,"" ash says with a smile. ""We picked him up, and then CS2 came out the next day. It just came out, and we were like, 'Oh, I guess we're playing a different game.' It was a little bit scary, having an older guy come in and have to learn the game again."" Despite this, GamerLegion started the first CS2 tournament, IEM Sydney, with a best-of-one victory over FaZe. They lost the rematch against FaZe in the lower-bracket final and were left without a playoff spot, but their start to life in the new game was encouraging. GamerLegion then ended the year with four back-to-back tournaments, the first being ESL Challenger Jönköping, where things took a turn for the worse. ""Right as we played Jönköping, I got sick, and it passed on to everybody. It was a super frustrating period that led to other problems, as we had the feeling that isak was going to leave. ""We had an uncertain period for about three months, saw our progress go backwards, and just getting to the next Major cycle was difficult. That was probably one of the hardest moments of my career. I just felt like people didn't really want to be here anymore."" After Jönköping, GamerLegion won just one match in the remaining three tournaments, a best-of-one against fnatic at Elisa Masters Espoo 2023, to go into the new year in dreadful form. ash says that the team desperately needed a roster change but couldn't make one due to their RMR invite. ""We had roles that just didn't fit. It felt like no matter what we did, we couldn't get an in-game leader who fit in similarly to siuhy, and we couldn't get a replacement for iM. The only way to get around that is to make three changes rather than two, but then we'd have to give up our RMR invite. ""We only made two, didn't get people who fit the roles, and just got rejected by everybody, which put us in a really poor position. We were suffering, and it wasn't anyone's fault. We considered a roster change, I think the team desperately needed it, but not because we thought Keoz wasn't good enough or something. It was just that the team was really desperate for it."" The rag-tag roster then came agonizingly close to a Copenhagen Major spot but fell at the last hurdle against 9 Pandas in the Last Chance Qualifier, which prompted the team to go their separate ways. As fate would have it, however, they were extended a lifeline as a replacement team for 9 Pandas and played one last tournament together. ""We informed Keoz that we wouldn't continue with him anymore after the RMR. I have to give massive credit to him because when we got the invite, he came back, and that must have been difficult for him. He's an amazing teammate, and everyone's loved him the entire time he's been here. ""I knew from behind the scenes that isak was probably not going to stay, and that acoR was probably joining TSM. We had a team that was a complete mess again, thrown into the Major at the last moment. We just began practicing with FL4MUS and changed all the positions around, and then we had to change them back again,"" ash said about their Major campaign that included wins against Legacy and AMKAL in the Opening Stage. ash's prediction came true after the Major, as Keoz and acoR departed the team to break up the Paris Major core, while Isak ""isak"" Fahlén left shortly after to join Ninjas in Pyjamas. ""I felt very sad because I worked with these guys for so long. But to get past this period of demotivation from the Paris Major and the struggles we had with the roster, it felt like we could get people who really wanted to be here,"" ash said. ""I think all the guys that left would admit they weren't 100% committed anymore. I'd seen them at their best, and this felt like we were just limping to the death of the team."" With the team broken up, ash and his team had a much less restrictive transfer plan, with Andreas ""aNdu"" Maasing and Henrich ""sl3nd"" Hevesi the first names through the door. The Estonian was an academy player in the organization and previously impressed the team with a positive showing at ESL Challenger Atlanta 2023. ""When we had an extra position open, giving aNdu a shot was a no-brainer. He was playing so well in FPL at the time, and he was available in a market where no one was affordable. He's completely the same on LAN as in practice, if not a little more confident, and that's exactly how sl3nd is as well. ""We had to take a gamble on sl3nd, obviously not knowing if he's like this, and this will be the key reason why he'll be a future tier-one player. We saw him a lot playing with Endpoint, and I was impressed with his consistency more than anything else. Being consistent tells you that he has a good mental side and some solid fundamentals."" The Hungarian AWPer hit the ground running for GamerLegion and averaged a 1.21 rating on his LAN debut at ESL Pro League S19, but the team's rebuild was far from over at that point. The next piece of the puzzle was Timur ""FL4MUS"" Marev, who ash describes as a pretty left-field pickup. ""He was a real obscure one. We were going through every possible metric we could to find this aggressive style player,"" the Brit spoke about the scouting process. ""He stood out in every single way, and when we looked at him, he was playing anchor positions and entering on the T-side. We also found his stream where he said a few words in English, and we were like: 'Wait, you can speak English?' This was just before Nemiga started doing well, so I think it was the only time we probably had the opportunity to make this signing."" With a young core and a veteran IGL in Snax, GamerLegion seemed to have completed their rebuild, but G2's offer for their captain threw another spanner in the works. ""It definitely came out of the blue. We were already planning for the next period of the team,"" ash said. ""Snax was sometimes quite frustrated with the decision-making in this team. He feels like he only has so many years left in the game, and he doesn't want to spend too much time playing with players who have to learn the game, even if they are playing at quite a high level already. ""It was an opportunity he wanted to take, and when that offer comes in from G2, it decides for you. I think Snax could be a great pickup for G2 because they are more of a team he would be motivated to play in at this stage of his career."" With Snax out of the picture, GamerLegion needed a new IGL at the helm once again. The man they chose was Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson, who has a lot of calling experience despite his young age and is someone ash considered once before. ""When we picked neaLaN up, ztr was a player we were looking super hard at, but his buyout at the time was kind of ridiculous. The signing matches many of the criteria we have about finding players who are motivated and want to be here, and I think his calling style is very similar to what siuhy was doing. He has a clear idea of how he wants to play the game, and it fits in with the players we have now. ""This is the vision we're taking now. If we can't attract the top players with the biggest reputation we'll take the up-and-coming players who want to be here and try to develop them as much as we can. We want to build a team for the future and try not to be this organization that's just selling players whenever an offer comes in."" With an average age of 20.6, GamerLegion are one of the youngest teams in the upper echelon of Counter-Strike, and ash says he will need to improve his leadership skills because of that. ""It's going to be a completely different dynamic that we need to adapt to, and I'm pretty aware of what we need with this team. This is also probably the best time in recent memory to pick up young players, as the new game has leveled the playing field quite a lot."" Despite another complicated transfer window for ash and his team, the British coach is satisfied with what the organization has accomplished. ""It was very stressful again, but I think we ended up signing players that were number one or two on our shortlist for the first time."" The conversation then transitioned to GamerLegion's goals for the season, and ash insists he remains focused on the long term. ""Our aim for the next year is jumping up the rankings significantly and building a team for the future that could be around the top 10 or maybe even further. ""We're ready to take that next step where we're not a selling team anymore, and we're going to build a team that's trying to win tournaments. It'll take a little bit of time because our players are so young, but we really think it's possible with the team we have."" With another busy season ahead of the Counter-Strike circuit and GamerLegion finally putting together a roster without restrictions, their potential could take them far above people's expectations. Their first test will come in just under a month at BLAST Premier Fall Groups, set to start on July 29. ""It's just the unknown of how a LAN event together will affect us. That will be a key component of our season, so I'd like us to be competitive at BLAST,"" ash concluded.",7-7-2024 21:50,1720381800000

YEKINDAR explains why cadiaN's leadership didn't work and addresses form criticism,https://www.hltv.org/news/39356/yekindar-explains-why-cadians-leadership-didnt-work-and-addresses-form-criticism,"""I understand fans who are angry about my form. My game is not worthy of my team and myself,"" the Latvian said in a recent podcast appearance. Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis appeared on a Friday podcast with Georgian YouTuber and founder of CYBERSHOKE Erik ""shoke"" Shokov. In it, he shared his thoughts on why Liquid's time with Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller didn't work out and addressed criticism about his form in 2024, among many other topics. When speaking about his former captain, who was benched after just six months on the new Liquid lineup, the Latvian suggested cadiaN's micro-managing style didn't fit the roster. ""At the beginning, I thought cadiaN shared a lot of similarities with Jame. The biggest similarity is that he does a lot of micro-managing of his players,"" YEKINDAR said. ""Generally, it's good, but I think most players lacked some individuality."" ""I explained that international teams are carried more by an individual level and decision-making. That's why I think there were some inconsistencies, like Twistzz arrived from FaZe where he had some freedom in his roles, same with me and NAF."" ""We had to adjust to each other a lot, so it was hard to find form as a team. There was no consistency,"" he went on. ""cadiaN is a smart captain, but in this lineup it didn't work with the individuals we had and teamwork."" The 24-year-old also addressed the community criticism he has faced in this new roster due to his underwhelming form. He averages a 1.01 rating against top 30 opposition in 2024, a steep drop from his time in Virtus.pro and earlier iterations of Liquid, which earned him the 8th and 15th spot on the Top 20 players of 2021 and 2022 rankings. ""I understand fans who are angry about my form. My game is not worthy of my team and myself,"" he acknowledged before going over the reasons behind his drop in form. YEKINDAR explained that despite putting more focus on his individual game since he stopped in-game leading upon the creation of the new Liquid, a lack of confidence has caused him to second-guess himself. ""I started playing a lot of FACEITs because I thought 'm0NESY plays a lot of FACEITs, donk plays a lot of FACEITs, I will too. It was great and I felt good when on FACEIT, but then I go to a tournament and kind of overthink,"" YEKINDAR said. ""When you suck for a while, you start believing less in yourself. These micro-moments when you decide to go or not to go, especially with my roles, they make a difference. When you overthink, you lose confidence, start playing worse and it becomes a never-ending cycle of mistrust in yourself. ""I started taking things easier. In the end, it's just a game and I understand I accumulated a lot of stress when I was in-game leading because of the fans. There is even a lot of skepticism about the fact that I was kept on the team, but in the end I realized I just need to enjoy it. Enjoy and don't worry, it will be all good if you deserve it."" In the podcast, YEKINDAR also shared new details around his departure from Virtus.pro in mid-2022, including two big names interested in him after his benching — MOUZ and G2. ""There were two teams who talked to me about making the move; the rest wanted to make changes after Cologne. Those were Liquid and MOUZ,"" the Latvian said. ""Many teams wanted me after Cologne. For example, if I were to join G2, it would have happened after Cologne. We talked but didn't reach an agreement."" He ended up joining Liquid after buying himself out of his contract with Virtus.pro. In the interview, YEKINDAR shared that the buyout figure was at least $500,000.

Where are they now: RUBINO,https://www.hltv.org/news/39360/where-are-they-now-rubino,"Regrets, highlights, advice; see what former pros are up to now and what they have to say about their careers after moving on from fragging on the server. Counter-Strike has had time for several generations of talent to rise to prominence and then fade away with a history spanning more than two decades. CS 1.6, Source, and Global Offensive each have their hall of fame, filled with players who have achieved or touched greatness at one point. Now, with the arrival of Counter-Strike 2, we have a new crop of aspirants who seek to follow in their predecessors’ footsteps. As we watch tomorrow's stars fight for glory on the world stage, we sometimes let our minds wander down memory lane to reminisce about our old favorites and the days gone by. Overcome by nostalgia, we might find ourselves tuning into a Christopher ""GeT_RiGhT"" Alesund stream to watch our old icons gather like dads at a barbecue, or start watching a FragBite Masters VOD unexpectedly presented by the YouTube algorithm. Some players still compete to this day, others have transitioned to a coaching or management role, and some have seemingly disappeared into thin air, leading us to ask: Where has life taken them? It was precisely this line of thought that inspired this series, in which we reconnect with the former faces of CS:GO and explore their lives after professional gaming. When we talk about Norway’s contributions to Counter-Strike, one can’t go without mentioning Ruben ""RUBINO"" Villarroel. Like many other household names in his national scene during Global Offensive, particularly the early days, he rose to prominence by playing for London Conspiracy and LGB. These formative years, highlighted by two Major appearances, eventually led him to the organization with which he would reach his most significant results: Dignitas. In November 2015, RUBINO joined the team alongside Kristian ""k0nfig"" Wienecke, marking the start of his foray into the Danish scene. Captained by Mathias ""MSL"" Lauridsen and powered by some of Denmark's rising talents, they had a strong showing throughout 2016 that culminated in a championship run at EPICENTER: Moscow and a momentary second place in the HLTV world ranking. Although he was a role player for a roster spearheaded by k0nfig and later on also Emil ""Magisk"" Reif, RUBINO was considered key in MSL’s system and could even deliver a game-winning performance from time to time. RUBINO left the game in 2020, but surprisingly, one of the first things he revealed was that he had contemplated hanging up the mouse as early as 2017 when the team signed for North. ""I planned to stop with Counter-Strike after I left North, as I had personal problems that caused a lot of stress, made it hard to focus on the game, and made me make some decisions that will probably haunt me for the rest of my life,"" he recalls. RUBINO then returned to Dignitas for the rest of 2017, playing with a European lineup that included countryman Joakim ""jkaem"" Myrbostad, and then went on to don the colors of HEROIC and Nordavind, but by then his difficulty focusing on the game became literal. ""I had iridocyclitis in my eyes, and it made me unable to see a lot and made me light sensitive,"" he explains. ""I was also forbidden from exercising and wasn’t allowed to sit in front of the computer for several months."" These difficulties, coupled with a previous desire to step away from Counter-Strike after his time with North, led RUBINO to make the final decision in 2020. ""What made me move on from Counter-Strike was that I felt that my hunger for the game was starting to fade, and I wanted to try something new,"" he confesses. ""I can say that if I look back at it, I should never have done this."" Ultimately, he found his drive to compete again in Valorant, reuniting with his former Dignitas teammate Christian ""loWel"" Garcia Antoran on Heretics. Unfortunately, the experience didn't live up to expectations. For a person in his late twenties, the Valorant scene couldn’t provide the type of stability he was looking for. ""It was really hectic as it was a new game,"" RUBINO says. ""Roster changes happened constantly, and being in two different teams within six or seven months was not something I looked for, as I started to become older and was more reliant on a safe and stable income, which was not a thing when you changed teams this often."" Though RUBINO has since retired and now plays only casually, he still looks back at an excellent Counter-Strike career. Two memories, in particular, stand out for him above the rest. The first is winning EPICENTER: Moscow over one of the best teams at the time: Virtus.pro. Their victory in Moscow was something above their expectations and ended up being his most cherished experience. RUBINO was a key performer in the pivotal second map of the series, where Dignitas punished Virtus.pro on the Poles' map pick, leading to a reverse sweep. The second moment was qualifying for his first Counter-Strike Major. Together with Bjoern ""Skurk"" Maaren, Preben ""prb"" Gammelsæter, Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard, and Pål ""Polly"" Kammen, RUBINO took down Ladislav ""GuardiaN"" Kovács’s Natus Vincere to qualify for ESL One Cologne 2014 under London Conspiracy while delivering the best performance on the team. Whenever there is light, though, there are also shadows. A professional career doesn’t come without its trials, of which RUBINO faced his fair share. ""I think I was pretty unlucky, if I’m honest,"" he says. ""Probably 1% of pro players will ever have these kinds of issues since it is really rare that someone gets iridocyclitis, although getting tendinitis in my shoulder was mostly because I didn’t exercise a lot, and I was holding my mouse and sitting in a really bad position which made that happen."" RUBINO was forced to take extended breaks from the game to focus on recovery towards the end of his playing days, and now he's taking this opportunity to caution younger players about exercising properly and paying attention to their wrist and shoulder health in order to avoid ending up in a similar situation. ""I promise you that the recovery process of getting it to work properly again is not fun,"" he warns. RUBINO was always vocal about burnout and the psychological aspect of the game and the circuit during his playing days. For him, the biggest problem was the challenging schedule they had to face, something which could return almost a decade later, in 2025. ""I thought that events were pushing each other way too much, and if you wanted to stay up in the ranking, you were kind of forced to attend every single tournament, or else you would probably lose the next invite if you didn't accept,"" he recalls. ""In the end that results in players burning out since they don't really get any break."" ""It's the same with the lower tiers. You need to attend every single tournament to get recognized and, even if you do, you have a small chance of getting the call-up."" As he mentioned previously, making decisions under such duress may ultimately lead to regrets. ""The only thing I really regret was giving up on the Dignitas/North roster, which I did really fast after we joined North,"" he reflects. ""But basically, the support system we had those days was not even close to what it is today. Personal problems came up and not having someone to talk to made me make a decision that was not good for me, so I guess that's it."" Leaving the past in the past, we changed the conversation to the future and what it has in store. When asked about his thoughts on Counter-Strike 2, he admitted that he hasn’t played it that much yet, but his initial impressions have been positive. The one complaint he brought up was the number of cheaters he encountered in matchmaking. ""Please fix premier!""  he appeals to Valve. The possibility of returning to the professional scene in any capacity was discussed, but his answer was uncertain. ""I think my days as a Counter-Strike player are probably done. I'm 30 years old, so doing analyst work or coaching could be a potential thing to do, but I'm not sure,"" he concludes. As for his legacy, he hopes to be remembered for his commitment and hard work ethic. ""Grinding is the way to go; you can get places by grinding. Maybe you don't have the same talent as the best players, but you still have a shot if you grind and learn. Nothing is impossible, it’s what you make of it."" Asked if if there was anything on his mind about his career that he wanted to get out there, RUBINO replied with a sense of contentment and acceptance. ""I had a fun experience during most of my career, and I would never have not wanted it,"" he says. ""Was it turbulent from time to time? Yes, it was, but I still enjoyed most of it. ""I made some bad decisions and had some bad luck, but I still will never forget about Counter-Strike. It is by far the best game ever made, and I hope it will continue like this for a long time."" RUBINO expressed one final desire, however, involving his former teammates and countrymen jkaem and rain: that they form a Norwegian team and take that team to a Major before calling it a day. ""Also, to the people who supported me: thanks. It really meant a lot.""",9-7-2024 15:00,1720530000000
Official: FURIA sign skullz,https://www.hltv.org/news/39353/official-furia-sign-skullz,"The 22-year-old returns to a Brazilian project after a short-lived stint with Liquid. FURIA have completed the signing of Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros from Liquid, the Brazilian organization has announced. The 22-year-old will fill the void that was created in April, when the team moved Andrei ""arT"" Piovezan to the bench after a series of lackluster results. skullz spent the last seven months in Liquid's ranks following his transfer from paiN in December 2023. Despite his hefty buyout, believed to be in the region of $600,000, he struggled to impress while with the team and averaged only a 0.98 rating on LAN. Without surprise, skullz found himself on the chopping block after a disappointing season that saw Liquid miss out on a Major spot and fail to challenge for trophies. As part of the off-season rebuild, Liquid also benched in-game leader Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller and parted ways with head coach Wilton ""zews"" Prado. A move back to a Brazilian team could present the opportunity for skullz to reignite his career. His arrival might be the shot in the arm that would catapult FURIA to outside contenders once again. A title-winning campaign at Elisa Masters Espoo 2023 restored a sense of joy to FURIA, but the team cut a frustrated figure during the first quarter of 2024, leading to the departure of arT, who had been with the team since early 2018. During the final months of the season, FURIA played with Kayke ""kye"" Bertolucci as a stand-in, but the academy graduate failed to make an impression and was often the target of fierce criticism for his performances. Alongside skullz's arrival, Nicholas ""guerri"" Nogueira announced he had completed the transition to a Head of Esports role within the organization, making way for assistant coach Sid ""sidde"" Macedo to take charge of the team. Former FaZe analysts Hunter ""Lucid"" Tucker and Viacheslav ""innersh1ne"" Britvin, the latter of whom also coached Aurora and BetBoom, have been brought on to bolster the coaching staff. The organization also revealed that Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato and Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos have re-signed with FURIA for three years, quelling any rumors of moves to new teams upon the expiry of their five-year-long contracts. skullz will make his first appearance for FURIA next week, at the Esports World Cup, where the Brazilians will face Natus Vincere in the first round. Later this month, they will also attend the Skyesports Championship, in Mumbai, India.

Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato and Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos have renewed their deals with FURIA for three years, the Brazilian organization has announced. ""They're not leaving FURIA,"" Nicholas ""guerri"" Nogueira, now the organization's Head of Esports, stated in a video. ""They started all of this with us; they are FURIA. They will spend another 3 years with us."" The news was revealed alongside the signing of Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros and confirmation of Sid ""sidde"" Macedo taking over as head coach for guerri, with the organization also bolstering their coaching staff with former FaZe analysts Viacheslav ""innersh1ne"" Britvin and Hunter ""Lucid"" Tucker. The re-signing of KSCERATO and yuurih quells uncertainty and rumors of their future with the Brazilian organization as their five-year-long contracts, inked in June 2019, were due to expire. KSCERATO's fate was of particular interest as the four-time top-20 player in the world was previously targeted by Liquid during their December 2023 rebuild, but turned down the offer to continue playing with FURIA. He has regularly emerged as a candidate for other top teams, with fans and pundits often criticizing FURIA for ""wasting KSCERATO's prime"" as the organization has struggled to compete for top international trophies despite his rifling excellence while he was locked into an extended contract. yuurih and KSCERATO are FURIA's longest-tenured players, joining the organization in November 2017 and February 2018, respectively. The team found rapid success domestically after the latter's addition alongside Andrei ""arT"" Piovezan, and soon completed a move to the United States to compete internationally. They made an immediate impression on the world stage with a handful of deep runs at Big Events and established themselves as Brazil's next top team, but couldn't capitalize on their early momentum after returning to LAN post-COVID. Outside of a few titles during the online era, FURIA failed to lift big international trophies, only recently breaking a five-year-long title duck at Elisa Masters Espoo in November 2023. The organization cut a particularly frustrating figure in recent months, with role overlaps, a style imbalance, and poor results leading to the departure of arT and a stand-in stint with academy member Kayke ""kye"" Bertolucci, who failed to make an impression. KSCERATO's decision to turn down Liquid's offer also drew criticism from the community, who could no longer point only to FURIA for poor roster decisions and results that have left the 24-year-old without top trophies. His and yuurih's three-year contract extension comes at what the organization can only hope will be a turning point as they make substantial changes to the team, overhauling their coaching staff and signing skullz from Liquid. In the announcement, guerri also hinted at the possibility of more additions to the team in the near future, but didn't go into detail. ""I am thinking of bringing in more people; this is not something that will stop here, so expect more news in the future,"" he said. ""I hope you enjoy it. We have been among the best in the world for at least 4 or 5 years. Our goal is obviously to be the best in the world, but we haven't achieved that yet. It's not something that happens overnight, just as it wasn't for other teams in the past. But we are always striving for improvement and growth, so I count on your support.""",9-7-2024 18:49,1720543740000

Lake is an unknown quantity internationally, recording 172 maps on HLTV in 17 months and only playing at two North American LANs, Fragicago 2023 and launders LAN 2024. He has turned heads domestically since joining Carpe Diem in January, however, impressing with a 1.13 rating, 1.32 impact rating, and 85.2 ADR over 51 maps while attempting a similar number of opening duels as malbsMd in ESL Challenger League. That overlap in roles and the 19-year-old's potential offers M80 the chance to bet on developing new talent rather than seeking out a transfer from another organization, and retains the team's status as an Americas-majority roster for the Shanghai Major RMR.

Corey ""nettik"" Browne and Rooster have parted ways, the Oceanic side announced on Twitter, marking the end of his four-year tenure with the organization-less team. Sources told HLTV at the end of June that the 20-year-old was high on the shortlist of a new team headed by former Renegades and 100 Thieves in-game leader Aaron ""AZR"" Ward under Hong Kongese organization TALON. nettik first joined Rooster in February 2020 when he was only 16 years old. Despite his age he quickly became one of the team's best performers and remained a part of the core, which also represented Paradox, for nearly four and a half years through various iterations. After playing solely in the Oceanic scene through COVID, nettik finally got to play abroad after Rooster qualified for two consecutive ESL Pro League seasons in 2023 as well as the IEM Katowice 2024 Play-in.

Monte's squad is once again complete after the organization announced the signing of Olek ""hades"" Miskiewicz and Paweł ""dycha"" Dycha from ENCE. Former 9INE coach Piotr ""nawrot"" Nawrocki has also joined the team as an assistant coach to Sergey ""lmbt"" Bezhanov. The moves signify a clear shift in Monte. The Ukrainian organization now features a Polish core and only one player from its home country, Sergiy ""DemQQ"" Demchenko, and is set to play under new leadership following the departure of one of its founding members, Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk. The captaincy will transfer to hades. The Pole briefly took up leadership in late 2023 with 9INE after Wiktor ""mynio"" Kruk was let go from the team in November, a month before the core transferred to ENCE. hades and dycha were benched from ENCE in late May after their new Polish-majority roster went out early in PGL Major Copenhagen and ESL Pro League Season 19. It was hades' second benching from the Finnish organization as he was replaced by academy prospect Paavo ""podi"" Heiskanen despite being the team's highest-rated player in 2024. dycha, on the other hand, has struggled for form so far in 2024.

David ""prosus"" Hesse has been benched from BIG's active roster, the German organization announced on Wednesday. His replacement is expected to be announced shortly. The 21-year-old had been a part of the main team for over a year. After two stints on the BIG Academy roster, he was promoted last June and went on to play at several top tournaments, averaging a 0.97 rating on LAN in his time. BIG made it to the playoffs at ESL Pro League and secured a top-eight finish at IEM Dallas amid a slew of otherwise disappointing results.

BOROS completes Into the Breach rebuild,https://www.hltv.org/news/39368/boros-completes-into-the-breach-rebuild,"The Jordanian has a chance at redemption after a dismal end to his time with Falcons. Into the Breach have finalized their roster with the signing of Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas, who returns to activity after he was sidelined from Falcons in February following the team's failure to qualify for PGL Major Copenhagen. The 20-year-old is the last piece of the British organization's complete rebuild of its lineup, joining Owen ""smooya"" Butterfield, Nicolas ""Keoz"" Dgus, former Guild Eagles duo Flatron ""juanflatroo"" Halimi and Dionis ""sinnopsyy"" Budeci, and coach Gustavo ""Juve"" Alexandre. BOROS makes the move to Into the Breach from Falcons, for whom he has plied his trade since June 2023. He joined the Saudi organization after a breakout year with Monte, where his exceptional mechanical aim at the BLAST.tv Paris Major and its Europe RMR helped the team secure a quarter-final finish. However, his ensuing stint in Falcons left far more to be desired, with initial roster instability and lackluster results prompting the organization to reassess heading into 2024. Falcons' attempt at an ambitious roster overhaul, which brought together the core of the No.3-ranked ENCE squad and 2023's Anchor and Coach of the Year HLTV award winners, Emil ""Magisk"" Reif and Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen, went wayward after the blockbuster signing of Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač fell through at the 11th hour. Left without the Bosnian superstar and with most teams locking in rosters for the Copenhagen Major RMR and qualifiers, Falcons kept BOROS on the active lineup and tried to make things work, but role conflicts and early discussions of issues within the team made clear that there were some teething issues. BOROS' initial discomfort in meshing with the style of the team showed in their BLAST Premier Spring Groups debut, where he posted a 1.05 rating as Falcons were sent to the Showdown, but he seemed to redeem himself after he mustered a team-high 1.12 rating at IEM Katowice and helped earn his team a semi-final finish. Falcons fumbled when it most mattered, however, missing PGL Major Copenhagen by exiting the Europe RMR with a 1-3 record. BOROS averaged a 0.92 rating in that effort, and controversy later ensued when a (now-edited) documentary publicized frustrations within the team about him switching his mouse between games and complaining about it during live matches. He was benched soon after the team's exit and has remained sidelined since, with his move to Into the Breach now offering him a chance at redemption. The British organization previously referred to its final signing as its ""star rifler,"" and BOROS will have the opportunity to prove worthy of that status as he makes a bid to return to the level seen from him on Monte. The team's debut will be one to keep an eye on, although their first event remains unknown with the tournament break still underway until July 14. Into the Breach is now: Owen ""smooya"" Butterfield Dionis ""sinnopsyy"" Budeci Flatron ""juanflatroo"" Halimi Nicolas ""Keoz"" Dgus Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas Gustavo ""Juve"" Alexandre (coach) Karol ""rallen"" Rodowicz (benched)",10-7-2024 18:01,1720627260000
M80 replace NRG in BLAST Fall Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39369/m80-replace-nrg-in-blast-fall-showdown,"The American-majority team will get additional European playtime with newcomer Lake. NRG have withdrawn from BLAST Premier Fall Showdown ""due to Shanghai Major playing commitments and scheduling"" and have been replaced by M80, the tournament organizer announced on Tuesday. Elias ""s1n"" Stein's side received the invite due to finishing as the runners-up to NRG in Ace North America Masters, the NA qualifier for the Fall Showdown. BLAST Fall Showdown is scheduled to run from August 21-25, concluding just one day before the start of the Perfect World Shanghai Major North America RMR closed qualifier (scheduled for August 26-28). NRG are currently ranked No. 16 on Valve's regional standings — last updated on June 18 —, which is enough to earn them a direct invite to the NA closed qualifier but not to the Americas RMR. Although details for the Fall Showdown have not been announced, recent iterations of the tournament have been played online in Europe. As such, NRG could have been forced to fly overnight over the Atlantic and play the Major qualifier the next day if they made it to the final round of the Showdown. The team that recently added Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella has no chance to earn a direct invite to the Americas RMR as the ranking cut-off is on August 7 before IEM Cologne. Esports World Cup and BLAST Premier Fall Groups are the only post-summer break tier-one events to provide ranking points toward Major qualification, and NRG only have ESL Challenger League Season 48 on their calendar, which won't conclude until October. M80 is on the cusp of the Americas RMR qualifying threshold in eighth place with a 43-point lead over RED Canids, which would narrowly snag them the final direct invite to the event as the standings are now. However, RED Canids and several South American teams just below them on Valve's ranking are currently competing in CBCS Season 5, which will conclude on July 14 and impact the ranking before the cut-off. M80 can also garner additional ranking points at EWC in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, but face a difficult challenge as they will be making their debut with newcomer Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson against Vitality. The substantially higher level of teams at EWC and minimum $10,000 takeaway — the same as first place in CBCS Season 5 — should keep M80 above RED Canids, but their spot at the Americas RMR is not yet guaranteed. The invite to the Fall Showdown offers M80 the opportunity to play additional practices and officials in Europe with Lake, who has zero international Counter-Strike experience. Alongside M80, the team list for the event includes two European qualifier winners, Zero Tenacity and AMKAL, with the bottom-placing ten teams from BLAST Fall Groups and the winners of qualifiers in Asia and South America to join in the coming weeks.",10-7-2024 20:34,1720636440000

mithR joins Liquid,https://www.hltv.org/news/39376/mithr-joins-liquid,"The Danish coach is the first piece of Liquid's off-season rebuild. Liquid has announced the signing of former Apeks coach Torbjørn ""mithR"" Nyborg, marking the first official addition as part of the team's off-season rebuild. According to the lineup submitted by Liquid for BLAST Premier Fall Groups, Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak and Justin ""jks"" Savage are the remaining personnel left to be announced. Liquid undertook an ambitious rebuild of their roster in the most-recent winter player break, which included bringing in two-time Major winning coach Wilton ""zews"" Prado. After a string of lacklustre results across the first half of 2024, which included missing out on PGL Major Copenhagen, the team parted ways with zews in June. mithR takes up the head coach mantle having recently served in said role for Apeks, although he also has stints as a coach for MOUZ and Renegades on his CV. The Dane took over at Apeks in September 2023 after Jakub ""kuben"" Gurczyński departed for ENCE. mithR helped the squad maintain a spot inside the top 15 of the world ranking for much of his tenure, and the team achieved second-place finishes at Elisa Masters Espoo and ESL Challenger Atlanta with him at the helm.

The Mongolz miss out on BLAST Fall Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39377/the-mongolz-miss-out-on-blast-fall-showdown,"Asia's highest-ranked team will not make an appearance at BLAST Premier Fall Showdown after a disappointing performance in their regional qualifier. The MongolZ have crashed out of the group stage of 5E Arena Asia Cup Fall, and as a result will miss out on BLAST Premier Fall Showdown and a shot at qualifying for Fall Finals. The Mongolian side were punished by the best-of-one group stage format, which left little room for error. The MongolZ began their campaign in predictable fashion with a comfortable Inferno win over Steel Helmet, before a Rare Atom side freshly reinforced by Andrew ""kaze"" Khong crushed them on the very same map. The 11th-best team in the world according to HLTV's ranking should still have been able to secure a playoff berth in the tournament, as only the unranked CatEvil stood in their way, but their Chinese opponents pulled off the upset by virtue of a hard-fought victory on Ancient to eliminate The MongolZ. The early elimination comes as a shock as The MongolZ were in blistering form prior to the player break and bagged three tournament wins on the bounce, including LAN wins over European opposition at MESA Nomadic Masters and YaLLa Compass. This run of form saw the team rise to their current world ranking peak of No. 11. Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren and Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar were in fine form during this qualifier but could not make up for the underperformances of the rest of the squad, particularly those of Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch. The AWPer earned a HLTV MVP award at YaLLa Compass in June but was a shadow of himself during 5E Arena Asia Cup Fall, posting a 0.76 rating over three maps. The Mongolians will need to dust themselves off quickly as Esports World Cup is just around the corner, where The MongolZ will open their campaign against a newly-revamped G2 squad.",12-7-2024 12:37,1720780620000

He struggled to make an impression during the first years of his career, but he has managed to elevate his game in Counter-Strike 2, in which he is averaging a 1.16 rating, albeit against mostly lower-level opposition (he has yet to face a top 20 team in CS2). ultimate will take over AWPing duties from Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller, who was benched by Liquid as part of an off-season overhaul that saw Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros transferred to FURIA and Wilton ""zews"" Prado relieved of his post as head coach.

Rare Atom qualify for BLAST Fall Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39384/rare-atom-qualify-for-blast-fall-showdown,"Rare Atom converted upon their win over The MongolZ in the group stage by beating TYLOO in the final. Rare Atom have secured a spot in BLAST Premier Spring Showdown after topping the Asia qualifier, 5E Arena Asia Cup Fall, over TYLOO. It was an early moment of revenge for Andrew ""kaze"" Khong, whose debut tournament after returning to Rare Atom ended with a 2-1 win over the organization he just departed. Rare Atom's youngest players, 20-year-old Yihang ""L1haNg"" Li and 24 year-old Junhao ""ChildKing"" Peng, led the team's seven-map charge through the qualifier's GSL group stage and single-elimination playoff bracket, averaging 1.41 and 1.29 ratings, respectively.

TSM's new roster has roared to life with a tournament victory in Skin.Club Summer Cup, defeating Sashi 2-1 in the grand final of the eight-team event to take home 80% of the $16,080 prize pool. The American organization overhauled its roster during the tournament break, breaking away from its failed European consortium to return to an all-Danish lineup with the additions of Frederik ""acoR"" Gyldstrand, Alexander ""Altekz"" Givskov, and Nikolaj ""niko"" Kristensen. The move has already paid off with an online title win, the organization's first since ESEA Autumn Cash Cup 3 in October 2023, and the new-look roster is looking far more promising than TSM's last as its individuals took turns leading charges to victory. The GSL group stage saw the team pick up two victories over Passion UA on either side of a 1-2 loss to FLuffy Gangsters to reach the playoffs, with a subsequent win over Johnny Speeds — a roster that was on the rise prior to the departure of Jonas ""Lekr0"" Olofsson — setting up an all-Danish grand final between TSM and Sashi. The depth of TSM's individuals was showcased in full force during the final as a different player topped the board on each map. Valdemar ""valde"" Bjørn Vangså's side looked comfortable throughout the series and were in firm control of their Mirage pick and the Ancient decider with 13-6 and 13-7 wins, respectively, and could have ended it in two maps if not for a squandered map point on Sashi's Nuke pick that allowed Oliver ""IceBerg"" Berg's team to edge out a 16-14 win in overtime. Altekz ended the event as its highest-rated player, mustering a 1.27 rating over seven maps, with valde not far behind with a 1.23 rating. 9INE's overhauled roster also took part in the tournament but stumbled in Group A, losing to Sashi and Endpoint to be eliminated in last place.

Four of the most hype transfers that ultimately flopped,https://www.hltv.org/news/39375/four-of-the-most-hype-transfers-that-ultimately-flopped,"There have been plenty of blockbuster moves across CS history, but which earned the highest billing only to flop spectacularly? This pair of moves was fascinating on paper. The Brazilian legends initially brought Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip in when they were SK, and less than six months down the line added Tarik ""tarik"" Celik just after the team became MIBR. Combining two of NA's best players with the Brazilian core that had won two Majors and put Brazil on the map was a narrative slam dunk. The Americas region was united under one team, two American stars fresh from winning NA's only Major trophy in history and competing for the top spot in the world ranking, married with one of the game's era-defining cores. The trio of Fernando ""fer"" Alvarenga, Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo and Marcelo ""coldzera"" David had slipped from their position as the dominant force in CS by the time Stewie2K was added. In 2017 they won a plethora of titles, their last coming in December at ESL Pro League Season 6, but results waned in early 2018, culminating in a dire performance at WESG World Finals where they lost to a BIG ranked outside the top 20 and a mix team representing Russia to exit in groups. As a result of their decline, the Brazilians made changes and ditched Epitacio ""TACO"" de Melo. With Stewie2K among their number, the team had managed a couple of wins at lesser LAN events where they had been the only top squad in attendance, but at Big Events had managed a single top-four, and that was it. The addition of tarik in place of Ricardo ""boltz"" Prass brought with it a modest improvement in results, they bagged a couple of second-place finishes with one coming at the reasonably stacked ECS Season 6 Finals, but their only LAN win came at ZOTAC Cup Masters 2018, where again MIBR were the only top team in the running. Instead of setting the world alight, the team was a damp squib. Language issues plagued the squad, something that was a blindingly obvious potential problem when the lineup was brought together, there was virtually zero improvement from the all-Brazilian roster that came before, and overall the team stayed stuck in the mud as one on the fringes of the top-five, but seemingly unlikely to actually crack the top-five and stay there. tarik and Stewie2K's MIBR make the list because it essentially felt like all of the players stood still for eight months, even though the team was by no means terrible. The greatest Brazilian players of all time diluted their status as the leading lights of Brazil for little reason, whilst two of NA's greats exited the best NA lineup, which was No. 2 in the world at the time, and also saw no benefit. Arguably, all this lineup did was hamper the success and potentially the development of both of their home regions. Who are some of the best and most successful riflers in CS:GO history? Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač of course. If you go further back, players like Olof ""olofmeister"" Kajbjer and coldzera will of course come to mind. If you want to talk about longevity, Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard surely deserves a mention. What if I told you all four of these legends once played on the same FaZe roster? Over the course of much of 2019 FaZe had struggled and stumbled, unable to find a solution to their IGL problems after the players had mutinied at the end of 2018 to have Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen ejected from the roster. So of course FaZe picked up an IGL to right the ship? Wrong. They instead decided to load up on even more firepower and brought coldzera into the fold to create one of the most stacked rosters, on paper, of all time. NiKo took up the IGL reins, olofmeister was moved to the AWPing role, and a fresh-faced Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants was brought onboard as a rifler. Thus, Frankenstein was born. Unsurprisingly, what ensued was largely underwhelming, considering the level of talent on the roster. The squad struggled to find their feet in the first few months, flopping ESL One New York and posting middling results online in ECS, with coldzera and NiKo struggling to both find enough space within the team. The community did get a brief glimpse of what could have been with this roster, however, as they made a dominant run to the trophy at BLAST Pro Series Copenhagen, smashing virtually all opposition to pieces along the way. Beyond that there was little else to get excited about over the rest of 2019 for FaZe, but coming into 2020 there was still some optimism that they could find the form that saw them dominate in Copenhagen consistently. broky was handed the AWP as olofmeister returned to his usual lurking roles, and with plenty of officials under their belt and an off-season to figure things out, surely FaZe were about to really get going. Not so much. olofmeister was barely a shadow of his former self and struggled badly across the first few events of the season, with FaZe failing to go deep at either IEM Katowice or ESL Pro League. He quickly stepped down from the roster citing issues with burnout and motivation. Aurimas ""Bymas"" Pipiras came in and FaZe managed back-to-back third-place finishes, but the Lithuanian struggled overall and was ditched after FaZe's embarrassing cs_summit 6 performance. Markus ""Kjaerbye"" Kjærbye was the next to attempt to fill olofmeister's shoes, and after a couple of poor finishes FaZe showed another glimpse of their potential peak level, as the squad stormed to the title at IEM New York. Results fell off a cliff immediately after, and by this point the marriage of NiKo and coldzera was basically over. It was already widely known that G2 were closing in on a deal for NiKo by the time of FaZe's triumph in New York, and when the Bosnian did make the move in late October, that was essentially the end for that iteration of FaZe. The organization rebuilt with karrigan at the helm early in 2021. No prizes for guessing why this transfer makes the list. Four of CS:GO's greatest riflers were crammed into a single team, and for a couple of the briefest and most glorious moments, we saw the immense potential that was there just waiting to be unlocked consistently. Instead, olofmeister was shunted into the AWP role, coldzera never really lived up to expectations and was particularly poor in 2020, and NiKo took a hit to his individual level as a result of taking on the IGL role. The partnership between NiKo and coldzera serves as proof that a team stacked with firepower can easily become less than the sum of its parts. The hype for this one was off the scale. Two Major winners and best-in-role candidates, Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov and Ilya ""Perfecto"" Zalutskiy, were brought into a squad that was struggling to recapture the form that saw them compete for the title of best team in the world as Gambit during the online era. With Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov and Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov already among Cloud9's number, both ranked among the top five in HLTV's top 20 for 2022, this seemed on paper like a roster that could win every single trophy on offer. The hype died real quick. After and underwhelming but not disastrous IEM Cologne showing, the team were easily cast out of Gamers8, completely flopped at EPL S18 to exit the tournament without even getting close to the playoffs, then bounced out of IEM Sydney, CS2's first event, with a single win to their name. This was not good enough for the personnel Cloud9 sported, and it didn't even look like they were moving in the right direction and getting any better. The lack of a proper IGL was blindingly obvious, and electroNic was suffering in individual terms whilst providing passable calling at best. Then the roster took a monumental hit as sh1ro stepped down seemingly out of nowhere, suggesting that not all was well behind the scenes. Rather than bringing in another sniper, Cloud9 opted to solve the leadership issue by bringing Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov into the fold, but that simply shifted the problem to the AWP role instead. Ultimately Cloud9 were probably slightly better without a proper AWPer than without a proper IGL. Results swung modestly in the right direction, a couple top-fours and a playoff appearance at PGL Major Copenhagen followed, but their inability to go toe-to-toe with the best teams in the world, largely due to the lack of a potent sniper, resulted in what seemed like a natural conclusion: the roster was blown up following the departure of electroNic, and the team are now in the process of rebuilding from the ground up. This set of transfers makes the list for obvious reasons. On paper, this team seemed like a shoe-in for a multitude of trophies, a Major victory, and to take the throne as the dominant team in the world. Instead it wavered and stumbled, we didn't get to see the potential realized in even a single game, and we watched the roster hamstrung first by the lack of a proper leader, and then the lack of a proper AWPer. It feels like this superteam never got the chance to make a real go of it. Admittedly Liquid had already gone down the international route with the signings of Aleks ""Rainwaker"" Petrov and Robert ""Patsi"" Isyanov mid-way through last year, but those were riskier pickups and it was easy to brush that off as a false start once rumors surfaced of the powerhouse they were creating for 2024. One of the greatest and most-decorated players from the region was returning home in the form of Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken, and the incoming Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller was a highly-touted IGL whose relentlessly proactive and creative mid-rounding style of CS had significantly influenced the tier-one meta. Top that off with a multi-Major winning Brazilian coach in Wilton ""zews"" Prado and Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros, one of the hottest prospects in South America, and it really felt like Liquid were cooking with gas. Sights were set on tournament wins, perhaps even Major trophies, and the expectations of the community were sky high. Unfortunately the squad suffered a rocky start in the team's traditional home region of North America, as they were completely unable to overcome the far less prestigious name of M80, dropped a series to Nouns, and labored to wins over virtual no-namers more than once. But no worries, right? It was the start of a lineup of disparate parts from different schools of CS, skullz was still quite raw, and with a decent number of officials under their belt, they would rock up to the Americas RMR on LAN and sweep the competition with ease. Let the car crash commence; Liquid failed to qualify for the Major thanks to losses to FURIA and Complexity. It was certainly not the kindest schedule, other teams qualified with far weaker runs, but Liquid didn't even run either Complexity or FURIA particularly close. In their next outing they lost to SAW to eliminate them from BLAST Spring Finals contention, and things were already looking bleak for the star-studded roster. Whilst Liquid's level began to crawl in the right direction over the course of the next few tournaments, rewarding them with playoff appearances at IEM Chengdu and ESL Pro League, flaws in their play remained apparent. skullz was struggling to translate his previous success into tier-one play, decision-making his obvious weakness, Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis continued to be a shadow of his former self, and cadiaN seemingly couldn't instil his favored style of play in the team. There were clear rumblings of discontent off the server as well, with differences in vision for the team becoming apparent not only via the rumor mill, but also when viewing Liquid's footage from behind the scenes. The fact that Liquid ejected the entire leadership structure of the team in this off-season, dumping cadiaN and zews overboard, only serves as proof of these observations. Liquid's international superteam makes the list for two reasons. One, no player besides Twistzz seemed capable of living up to the hype. Two, it's such a painful roster to consider because on paper it should have been fire, but the rumors coming from behind the scenes are that the players could never get on the same page and buy into cadiaN's approach. Liquid moved even further away from their traditional identity as an NA team by ditching Josh ""oSee"" Ohm and Damian ""daps"" Steele to make this roster happen, and it bore absolutely zero fruit because they couldn't get everyone singing from the same hymn sheet.",14-7-2024 19:35,1720978500000
Wildcard complete lineup with susp and phzy,https://www.hltv.org/news/39389/wildcard-complete-lineup-with-susp-and-phzy,"The North American side have rounded out their ranks with European talent. Wildcard have announced the signings of Swedes Love ""phzy"" Smidebrant and Tim ""susp"" Ångström, bringing their roster back to capacity after earlier parting ways with Adam ""Grizz"" Golden and AWPer Keller ""SLIGHT"" Nilan. This move comes shortly after the team opted to add Vincent ""vinS"" Jozefiak, formerly of Anonymo and HONORIS in the coaching position, with the Pole taking on the role formerly held by Brazilian coach João ""horvy"" Horvath. Peter ""stanislaw"" Jarguz's side struggled to find much success during the first half of 2024, having to contend with fierce domestic competition from sides like M80, Nouns, and Liquid. The team reached the PGL Americas RMR, but bowed out with only a single win to their name after losses to RED Canids and the aforementioned M80. The team's last-minute fielding at IEM Chengdu led to less-than-ideal circumstances, and Wildcard ultimately exited in 13-16th place. There were bright spots for Wildcard, as the North American side snagged a place in ESL Pro League Season 20 in September thanks to their runner-up finish in ESL Challenger League Season 47 towards the end of the season. Although the team has opted towards a European shift with the acquisitions of two Swedish players and a Polish coach, the team will still enjoy being able to compete in the Americas RMR, being allowed to choose due to not having a majority of their lineup from a single region. Wildcard now field: Peter ""stanislaw"" Jarguz Josh ""JBa"" Barutt Aran ""Sonic"" Groesbeek Tim ""susp"" Ångström Love ""phzy"" Smidebrant Vincent ""vinS"" Jozefiak (coach)",14-7-2024 21:52,1720986720000

Former MIBR man Matheus ""Tuurtle"" Anhaia has been benched by ODDIK after almost a year on the starting roster. The rifler put up a 1.04 rating during his time with the team but ODDIK failed to distinguish themselves in their region, their peak of No. 47 in the world rankings making them only the 6th-ranked team in Brazil at the time. BC.Game, who have Ladislav ""GuardiaN"" Kovács at the helm as head coach, have just brought their roster up to three-strong with the signings of Joel ""joel"" Holmlund and Aleksandar ""CacaNito"" Kjulukoski. The pair join Guy ""anarkez"" Trachtman on the international squad. According to Dust2.us, Liquid captain Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella will not be joining M80's Counter-Strike squad after failing to reach an agreement about a transition from the organization's VALORANT squad. The 28-year-old has admitted to being interested in returning to CS. ""CS is home, and with the lack of IGLs in NA, this is where I belong. I still have a lot to offer to NA CS and can't wait to give CS2 everything I have,"" nitr0 said. Rare Atom have plucked experienced sniper Andrew ""kaze"" Khong out of free agency. They're now: YuLun ""Summer"" Cai HaoWen ""somebody"" Xu Andrew ""kaze"" Khong Yihang ""L1haNg"" Li Junhao ""ChildKing"" Peng Bobby ""stamina"" Eitrem has departed his role of analyst for M80, citing the difficulty of balancing his CS work with his 9-5, and is open to a playing role once again. ""I was on a trial contract at M80 and wanted to extend as a full time assistant coach/manager after, which unfortunately did not happen. ""They offered me to stay in my current role, but doing that and working a 9-5 is really tough and I was never looking to stop playing entirely in the first place. ""Now that I can play again, I'm back."" Liquid have enacted their second roster change of the off-season by removing Wilton ""zews"" Prado from the coaching role. The Brazilian tactician follows Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller out of the roster, with Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros' departure also expected to be confirmed soon. The last time Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella abandoned VALORANT to return to CS, he went straight back to his long-time home of Liquid. However, editor-in-chief of Dust2.us Ryan Friend says not to expect the same this time around. Ryan is often in the know when it comes to movements behind the scenes in NA CS, and he broke the news of nitr0's potential return. Nemiga have announced the signing of 16-year-old Ivan ""zweih"" Gogin as a replacement for Timur ""FL4MUS"" Marev, who recently joined GamerLegion. zweih has already played 12 maps with Nemiga and averaged a 1.21 rating, helping the team win RES Regional Series 5 Europe. Nemiga are now: Kirill ""Xant3r"" Kononov Maksim ""riskyb0b"" Churikov Aliaksandr ""1eeR"" Nahorny Beksultan ""khaN"" Ospan Ivan ""zweih"" Gogin Anton ""boX"" Burko (coach) Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella has announced his intentions of returning to Counter-Strike once again, according to a report by Dust2.us. ""CS is home, and with the lack of IGLs in NA, this is where I belong. I still have a lot to offer to NA CS and can't wait to give CS2 everything I have,"" nitr0 said in a statement to Dust2.us. Imperial have opened transfer discussions with 9z about signing Santino ""try"" Rigal in place of Henrique ""HEN1"" Teles, Dust2.com.br has reported on Monday. Chapecoense have signed a Counter-Strike team for the first time in four years, three months after re-igniting their esports division with the help of General Eventos e Games. The players were picked at an in-person event in Chapecó. Eduardo ""ST9RM"" Everton ""GRILOON"" Henrique ""SPOLTI"" Igor ""AVR"" Leonardo ""SILVA"" Yesterday AMKAL benched Kaisar ""ICY"" Faiznurov from the team and launched an investigation into the player over suspicions he had engaged in ""unfair behavior."" Russian insider Alexey ""OverDrive"" Birukov has said the reason for this was that the Kazakh AWPer played practice games with Cloud9 without permission from his organization. According to sources, StarSeries i-League Season 8 and ESL One New York 2019 winning coach Chet ""Chet"" Singh is exploring options to return to Counter-Strike. Full story: Entropiq have benched their entire CS2 roster, citing ""changes in Major qualification"" as the reason for the decision. ""It took us a while because it was a very hard decision, but due to changes in Major qualifications that made us unable to take part in the biggest CS2 event of the year, Entropiq has decided to bench the CS2 roster with immediate effect,"" the organization said in a statement. After years of trying out international rosters with players from across Asia-Pacific, NKT has put together a full Thai lineup. The team is headlined by Kritthee ""Geniuss"" Sawatmuang, who was part of the Lucid Dream team that attended DreamHack Masters Dallas 2019. The full roster: Warittorn ""RoLEX"" Kalanukarn Kritthee ""Geniuss"" Sawatmuang Jinnapat ""zyven"" Huangmit Maitri ""MAIROLLS"" Sukrob Kitisak ""SeveN89"" Kititharakun Mere days after Thomas ""Thomas"" Utting revealed that 5W scammed its players and that the lineup had parted with the organization, the British captain announced that the players are going their separate ways despite initial plans to continue competing together. ""Unfortunately we haven’t been able to keep the 5W roster together, so we have decided to part ways and allow everyone to be F/A free agents,"" Thomas stated in a post on X. Former LDLC and G2 member François ""AMANEK"" Delaunay has found a home as a part of GhoulsW's new roster, which also includes Leo ""Svedjehed"" Svedjehed and former Anonymo rifler Dawid ""lunAtic"" Cieślak.

Earlier this week, Richard Lewis hinted during a live stream that Liquid was ""keeping tabs on"" breakout AWPer Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz, who has impressed since moving to Ninjas in Pyjamas from B8. The veteran journalist clarified that, while the information was from a reliable source, he had not verified it and encouraged listeners to take his words with a grain of salt. When asked about the rumor by Dust2.se, Erik Wendel, Director of Esports at NIP, admitted that there has been a lot of interest in r1nkle, but rebuked the possibility of a move. ""He doesn't want to go anywhere, he loves his team, and of course we want to keep him,"" Wendel stated. ""Not much to say other than we signed one of CS's big prospects, there are a lot of teams looking at him but he belongs in NIP."" Dominik ""Blogg1s"" Janita has signed for Slovakian side UNiTY after a short and unfruitful stint in China playing for Wings Up. On his stream, Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo admitted that FURIA are having a hard time to find a new coach to replace Nicholas ""guerri"" Nogueira, who will soon transition to a Head of Esports role within the organization. According to Dust2 Brasil, assistant coach Sidnei ""sidde"" Macedo is the favorite to replace guerri. ""It's not easy, there are a lot of names, we speak Portuguese and we want to continue speaking Portuguese, so if you want to get someone as a head coach and they don't understand Portuguese, it's difficult because they'll miss out on the majority of discussions, teamplay, details that are happening during games. It gets hard. ""Getting a foreign coach to listen to us speaking Portuguese is something that isn't working very well and has its difficulties. But it's not something that has been ruled out. ""We're trying to find someone to work with sidde. We really like his work. During the last tournament, where we reached the semi-finals, he was working more as a coach, doing the game planning. We'll see how it goes."" On X, Filipe ""NOPEEJ"" Dias has said that he is looking for a new project after taking some days off. He became a free agent at the start of the month after Secret decided to release their team. This was the first international challenge of his career. During his two months with Secret, the Portuguese player averaged a 1.02 rating. On X, Diogo ""cerolzin"" Terto has announced that he is no longer in FURIA Academy's starting lineup.

The natural move is to look for an AWPer and rifling in-game leader to complete the roster, but plenty is up in the air. Richard ""Richard Lewis"" Lewis has spoken on stream and linked them with NIP's Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz, while fans will continue to campaign for Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev to return to Liquid after eight years away.

If it's a single move, it would be a puzzling one: There is close to no role overlap between nexa's lurker-anchor spots and malbsMd's more active spacetaker ones.

"malbsMd interview: Journey to G2, anchor roles, learning from donk",https://www.hltv.org/news/39388/malbsmd-interview-journey-to-g2-anchor-roles-learning-from-donk,"One of G2's newest pieces spoke at length regarding the biggest step up of his career. One of North America's top prospects in recent years, Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa has received an unparalleled opportunity, being called up to G2 amidst the removals of Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković and Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen from the international side. While calls for changes in G2's ranks have been loud and clear throughout 2024, the additions of malbsMd and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski have raised new concerns, chief among them the latter player's ability to call shots at a title-winning level and how each player will adjust to issues of role overlap. In a lengthy interview with HLTV, malbsMd discussed his feelings about transitioning from domestic North American sides to a top international team, the prospect of taking on anchor roles, and his response to those attempting to predict the future regarding his new team. malbsMd kicked things off by sharing his feelings of vindication after getting the opportunity to join a big-name organization like G2. ""Coming from a really weird country for esports, having to learn two different languages, become pro, having this opportunity makes me feel good. It actually means that everything that I went through and all the effort I put in was worth it,"" the young Guatemalan rifler stated. ""It was a really good journey, and I think that everything that happened in my career was just to learn and make me ready for this moment. I'm very happy that everything happened on this timeline, and I'm proud of it too. ""You can imagine how happy I am to see my dad almost crying because he got to talk to TaZ, for example TaZ yells 'Let's go!' in the background, malbsMd laughs, or that he is super excited that I'm going to play with NiKo. It's an insane feeling that I really cannot describe."" Asked about his career journey and some of the trials he faced in his years in TeamOne amidst a crumbling pathway to the top in North America, malbsMd admitted that it was a labored path and one he likely made more difficult for himself. ""I think I made the path longer than I should have. As you know, I went through the Brazilian scene because I had no other opportunity in NA because I was not known enough. One day pesadelo discovered me in FPL and he was like, 'Yeah, we should bring this guy in,' and I got to learn Portuguese since then. ""I feel like if I had the opportunity before to communicate in a language I'm comfortable in, play my roles — aggro roles and not playing hard anchor on some maps — actually grow with it and get experience from those kind of roles, to change my roles in the future and have some experience knowing I'm good in my roles... Just as it's happening right now. ""I got the opportunity to play my good roles in M80, but I'm going to play big site anchor in G2 right now. But I know I can play good as the star rifler, so I can bring that knowledge into the big site anchor and learn from the other anchors while putting my knowledge from being a star rifler into that. ""I could have done a better path for me, but that's how it is. But I'm always grateful for getting to know the Brazilian culture, getting to know another language, which is not an opportunity that everyone has. It made me grow a lot as a person and as a player, so I'm thankful for everything that happened. All of the things happened for a reason and that's why everything brought me here."" malbsMd also took a moment to praise his previous team, M80, stating that he was ""so close to retiring,"" but that the North American organization provided him with an opportunity to continue plying his trade. He spoke about transitioning into more star rifler roles after Marcus ""maNkz"" Kjeldsen stepped back from active play, something he hadn't tried before, and laughed about how it has clearly paid off. '""I've never done this before but I can try it,'"" he said to the team when they proposed the switch. ""It was worth it laughs. I never thought I was going to be such a good star rifler. I wanted to be the best in CS2 because I knew this game was going to be a really good opportunity for me, and when I saw donk rising up, I was like, 'Alright, let's study this guy, what is he doing differently?' ""I saw what was going on, I found out what he was doing, and I got to play like him. I got to understand what he does, how he moves, how he shoots, everything, and then I put it into my game and into M80's game. Then I destroyed everyone; nobody in NA had a chance against me other than fl0m laughs."" malbsMd elaborated why he thought he wouldn't be such a good star rifler, admitting that while he has always been an aggressive player, he didn't think he would adapt well to having so many duels and being such an impactful player across the map. The Guatemalan rifler, like many fans, was blindsided by the offer from G2. After he had a stellar individual showing at the Americas RMR, malbsMd shared that he assured M80 Rory ""dephh"" Jackson that he hoped to continue with the team, knowing that offers were likely coming. ""Rory dephh came to me and he was like, 'Mario, you know you're playing super well, people are going to be watching you, they're going to be countering you, maybe you might get some offers in the player break.' ""And I was like, 'Yeah, I know and I expect it, but I'm not planning to leave you guys in any way.' But, everything changed in a moment. It's not every day that G2 knocks on your door. I never expected to get a G2 offer."" malbsMd shrugged aside the idea of buckling under the pressure and scrutiny from the public on his new team, referencing his time with TeamOne and 00NATION as a way to show he'd dealt with backlash before. ""You don't even know how Brazilian fans are, like holy fuck,"" he laughed. ""If we lost one match, I was getting messages like, 'Oh my god, you fucking suck,' 'How can you be in this team,' even if I was dropping 30 in a map. It was ridiculous, and I'm expecting to have the same thing here. ""Actually, I'm not expecting it to happen because I want to win, but I know that if we lose those things might happen and I'm ready for that. Everything that happened in my career was preparing me for this moment right now. I'm a grown-up guy now and I don't feel hurt by any of those messages anymore. They might hurt, yeah, but I'm not going to let it get into my game life."" Later on, malbsMd elaborated by discussing how his goals have shifted from just making playoffs to now aiming to lift trophies, adding that this ""was pretty motivating, because it means that I am one step closer to accomplishing my dreams."" On the topic of roles, the young rifler looked even beyond G2, stating that the ability to be flexible between roles would give him greater opportunities in the later stages of his career, giving him the chance to be an in-game leader or a coach rather than rigidly trying to hold onto his roles in the twilight years of his career. He also admitted that while his experience as a solid star rifler will aid in his transition to new roles, time and understanding will still be a necessary part of the transition to his being an anchor again. Regarding the difficulty of transitioning to these anchor positions, malbsMd believes that his time with Brazilian lineups will be a boon in that regard. ""Back then in Brazilian teams, we used to be very strong fundamentally, playing by the books. I feel like I get a good mixture of getting to do whatever I want and also playing by the books, knowing when to overpeek, knowing when to go back, knowing when to flash and repeek."" With a few days at G2's bootcamp under his belt, malbsMd was also confident when asked about how practice has gone and how he is adapting to his changes on the server. ""I'm not going to lie, I am doing well laughs. That's what I'm going to say. I am doing super well, even better than how I expected I was going to do. I'm even surprised by myself that I'm doing this good. ""There are some habits, like you get the opportunity to repeek in Connector on Mirage, but you cannot do it when anchoring A on Ancient, for example. There are some habits I still have, but I feel like I haven't done many mistakes... I'm not perfect, but I haven't done as many mistakes as other people transitioning from a star player to an anchor will do. I feel like I've been doing incredibly well from the time I've had to practice these roles, and I'm actually surprised."" New roles was not the only novelty that malbsMd discussed in the lengthy interview, as he also shared his feelings on his brief time working with big names like Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov — who he described as ""the best player I've ever seen"" — and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, and how it has been arriving in a team with established names. ""It's been nice. I thought it was going to be more strict in a way, that they were going to not let me be as much of a free player as I am right now, but even with Snax, they trust me a lot. If I want to do a play, they'll be like, 'Okay let's do this,' and we adapt the rounds really well to what I want to do. It's been a really good experience so far."" Touching on the Bosnian rifler and the public perception of an egoistic persona, malbsMd was clear about his initial feelings. ""Whenever you see NiKo slamming his desk, he's mad at himself. From the days I've been here, he has never had any weird situations where he's showing up with an ego or screaming at somebody, or anything like that. ""He has never been toxic, so I think people are just exaggerating it. He has been super nice to me so i think it's just a lie. He's a really good guy and of course his experience is really good to have on a team."" When discussing those critical of G2's new lineup, malbsMd stood firm in his faith in the team. ""I don't know why people feel like they can read the future, it's just stupid. If we get just a honeymoon period, and it happens that NiKo and m0NESY leave, it happens. What can I do?"" malbsMd concluded the interview by discussing his goals with G2, sharing that he hoped to be one of the top three teams in the world alongside his new teammates. But, with this in mind, the young rifler shared that he did not want to set "" so many expectations and then get frustrated."" ""I feel like my future is going to be bright with G2.""",15-7-2024 21:38,1721072280000

Valve unveils rulebook for hosting licensed events from 2025,https://www.hltv.org/news/39397/valve-unveils-rulebook-for-hosting-licensed-events-from-2025,"Valve's new comprehensive rulebook details requirements for tournament organizers to receive licenses for large-scale events. Valve has released a ""Tournament Operating Requirements"" rulebook, a set of rules and regulations for how tournament organizers can receive a license for hosting events in Counter-Strike 2 from 2025. This uncovers new details on Valve's previously announced plan to impose restrictions on invitations to large-scale events in order to combat franchising, which had become widespread in ESL and BLAST events in recent years, and create a more ""level playing field when ability is the only limit to teams' success."" Ranked and Unranked events The new rulebook first makes a distinction between ""Ranked"" and ""Unranked"" events — those that will contribute to Valve's Regional Standings (VRS) and those that will not. While Ranked events have to comply with strict rules on what teams can be invited based on the Regional Standings and qualifiers, Valve also allows organizers to host Unranked events without restriction on invitations. However, the total compensation for the individual Unranked events cannot exceed $100,000, and the compensation for all events hosted by the same licensee within a year cannot exceed $250,000. Most organizers of lower-tier online tournaments currently exceed that yearly amount, which means that, if they choose similar budgets for the following year, they will have to apply for Ranked licenses from 2025 and adhere to the comprehensive set of rules. Tier 1 and Tier 2 and invite limitations Another new distinction made in the rulebook are Tier 1 and Tier 2 events. Tier 1 events will be required to invite teams starting from the team ranked first in the Regional Standings, feature at least 16 teams across the closed qualifier and main event portion, and feed at least eight qualified teams into the main event. Tier 2 events can, if they choose to feature direct invitations from the VRS, only invite teams ranked ninth or lower. Both can, but are not required to, be supplemented by open qualifiers. Some of the biggest limitations on Ranked events include being required to invite 1.5 times the number of teams who will compete in the Main Event via the Regional Standings. Half of the teams competing in the Main Event can be invited directly, while the rest has to go through a closed qualifier. However, a closed qualifier can simply mean one of the stages of the same tournament, as shown in the example below. Example: Under these rules IEM Cologne or Katowice can retain their current format, inviting the top eight ranked teams straight to the main event and the remaining 16 to the Play-in, because the Play-in technically counts as a Closed Qualifier. While most invites for Ranked events have to be made according to the Valve Regional Standings, Valve also allows two Wildcard invites for every eight teams competing in the Main Event. The Wildcard teams however have to feature at least three players who at one point in the past 12 months were a member of a top-eight roster on the VRS, or have won a Tier 1 event in the past 12 months. These can also not be invited directly to the main event. Wildcard events Tournament organizers are allowed to host one Wildcard event for every three Tier 1 events completed. These can feature an unlimited number of Wildcard invites, provided the teams invited comply with the aforementioned rule. Other The rulebook also details requirements on announcement dates for tournaments and additional information such as the location, qualifiers, prize pool and more. For example, all Tier 1 events held in 2026 must be announced by January 1, 2025 — up to almost two years in advance. As Valve previously announced, tournament operators will be required to publish comprehensive information on how they compensate teams for attending their events. This will include any guaranteed payments for appearances, media rights fees and other revenue shares. In Section 5 called ""Competition / Integrity,"" Valve also stressed their stance against exclusivity agreements, discriminatory treatment of teams and potential conflicts of interest. The new requirements will offer an early look at the calendar of coming years on the heels of an already packed tournament schedule for 2025: A whopping 23 events are planned for the coming year after PGL and StarLadder revealed plans to return to regularly hosting Counter-Strike events.",17-7-2024 01:15,1721171700000

The Brazilian veteran was a part of the active roster for a year and helped them complete an impressive run at PGL Major Copenhagen, making it through the Challengers Stage and earning the team a considerable jump in HLTV world rankings, but results have slipped ever since and the team has now pulled the trigger on the move. During his stint, HEN1 was Imperial's second-highest-rated player, averaging a 1.15 rating (and somewhat muted 1.05 impact rating) over 238 maps. try mustered a 1.14 rating (1.12 impact) over 135 maps during his ten-month stint with 9z, but has yet to record an official in Counter-Strike 2 and will have to quell doubts about his form in the new game upon his arrival.

G2 defeat The MongolZ in hard-fought debut,https://www.hltv.org/news/39401/g2-defeat-the-mongolz-in-hard-fought-debut,"malbsMd and Snax taste victory after a gruelling series in Riyadh with anti-eco mishaps and clutches galore. G2's new lineup are off the mark after scraping past The MongolZ 2-0 (Ancient 13-11, Inferno 16-13) in their Esports World Cup opener. It was rarely comfortable for G2, who required 48 frags combined from Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač to take Ancient 13-11 and had to come back from 6-10 on the CT side of Inferno before prevailing in overtime to secure the 2-0 win. The result sees G2 skip straight to playoffs, while The MongolZ drop to the single-elimination BO1 last chance stage. New in-game leader Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski was in good spirits as he joined Freya ""Freya"" Spiers for a post-game interview, joking about Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas's ""really nice Mercedes"" and the Steam tag ""Inferno=lose"", but also shared some notable tidbits about his new side. First, he revealed talks with G2 as early as summer 2022 after Snax had stood in for ENCE. He then hinted that Vertigo ""is coming,"" with G2's permaban (expected to be Mirage or Vertigo) still a mystery. ""I'm trying my best"" to call, he added. ""I have a lot of experienced players on the team, who take a lot of calling. I had a bit more space than in practice, but, for a first match with little practice, a win is a win."" The freshness of the roster was most visible on G2's pick of Inferno, with clutches and anti-ecos going astray for both teams and The MongolZ far from their best aside from skipper Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren. There were promising signs on the G2 side as Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa retained his sharpshooting despite taking up new CT roles on both maps on display. The squad's new big site anchor did not see much action at the start of Ancient — something he'll have to get used to — but had his usual aim to rely on when tested and was far more comfortable on T side. Round 24 of Ancient, with G2 on a force buy around his saved AK, displayed him at his best, taking a B spawn to run past Cave and hit a double entry in Middle to confirm G2's 13-11 victory. But in truth, it was the NiKo and m0NESY show throughout with G2's new additions taking the back seat as their star duo put up 48 frags. That fact, in addition to G2 winning both pistols, tells a tale of an unconvincing win on Ancient and it was similar on Inferno as The MongolZ took 7-4 and 10-6 leads on what was the old G2's home map. After taking A on Ancient, it was Pit on Inferno for malbsMd and he was treated to a triple grenade in the face at 10-10 as The MongolZ won their second low-buy round of the second half. But those low buys — in addition to a 2v4, a 1v3 clutch from bLitz and 1v2 from Sodbayar ""Techno"" Munkhbold — helped hide some costly mistakes from The MongolZ in a5v5 situations in gun rounds. ""That was The MongolZ's C+, or B- game,"" reflected Janko ""YNk"" Paunović on the post-match desk. Regardless, it was a promising debut for G2: The star duo of NiKo and m0NESY delivered, with malbsMd offering big impact as the X-Factor they have missed since losing Justin ""jks"" Savage coincided with a drop in form for Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač. The Guatemalan will face sterner tests in his anchor positions as his play is analysed, but it is clear that he will be prioritized early-round on T side and have the freedom to make use of his almighty talent.",17-7-2024 16:47,1721227620000
MOUZ and FaZe uncomfortable but victorious in seasonal debut at EWC,https://www.hltv.org/news/39402/mouz-and-faze-uncomfortable-but-victorious-in-seasonal-debut-at-ewc,"Sashi and FlyQuest gave the favorites a run for their money but ultimately fell to the last-chance stage. MOUZ and FaZe are through to the quarter-finals at the Esports World Cup after squeezing past FlyQuest and Sashi, respectively, in the opening round of the tournament taking place in Saudi Arabia. The two losing sides fall to the last chance stage, where eight teams will battle in a best-of-one single-elimination bracket for a single spot in the quarter-finals on Thursday. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company had to pull off two comebacks to beat FlyQuest in a two-map series. They started Anubis down 4-8 on the favored T side as Christopher ""dexter"" Nong and Declan ""Vexite"" Portelli dominated them all around the map, but came back on the defense off of a crucial karrigan triple in the second-round forcebuy. Two map points weren't enough to secure the opening map win in regulation, but FaZe did so once in overtime, with Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants putting a bow on the map with this crucial quad-kill and clutch on low HP: Nuke ended up just as hotly contested despite FaZe being the ones to kick it off with a hefty lead. After being up 5-0, they ran into a wall and had to rely on their dominant defense once again to recover a 7-10 deficit in the second half. MOUZ were looking slow to start in their affair against Sashi as well and had to recover from an opening loss on Nuke, where Oliver ""kwezz"" Rasmussen ran circles around the world's No. 3 team. The favorites also got off to a bad start on Ancient's Terrorist side and needed Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman to turn around two 3v5s and a 2v5 situation in a span of four rounds to recover the half. From there on, though, they looked switched on, only letting go of one round on the CT side and then topping it off with an all-around comfortable win on Mirage.",17-7-2024 17:06,1721228760000

NAVI and Vitality march on in Riyadh,https://www.hltv.org/news/39404/navi-and-vitality-march-on-in-riyadh,"FURIA and M80 have dropped down to the gruesome last-chance stage. Natus Vincere and Vitality are through to the quarter-final stage of the Esports World Cup after beating FURIA and M80, respectively, in the $1 million tournament's opening round. It was not the debut FURIA's fans were hoping for, but it's justifiable to excuse much of what went wrong to an adjustment period between the team and Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros. The former Liquid anchor had a solid debut performance, but the team still felt disjointed and too reliant on Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato, almost getting blown out 13-0 on Mirage after a stinker of a CT performance. Natus Vincere were in control for large portions of Nuke, though they left it late to secure the win, only putting the game to bed in the final round of regulation as FURIA staged a comeback after finding themselves down 11-5 on their own map pick. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy was the hero with 31 frags to his name, with Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov and Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius also having the occasional impactful round, especially on the CT side. The 21-year-old maintained that momentum on Mirage, pushing NAVI into an early lead with a stylish knife clutch in the pistol round. That was the start of a flawless half by the Major champions, who went 12-0 against the helpless Brazilians before sealing the deal six rounds into the second half after Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos denied the 13-0 blowout with a pistol clutch. Over on the B stage, it was business as usual for Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut, who led Vitality to a 2-0 victory, with Vertigo going the full distance. Playing their first LAN event with Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson, M80 nearly secured their map pick, only to let the game slip away in the dying stages. Dust2 was a much more one-sided affair as Vitality were in control from the opening exchanges, with ZywOo adding 19 frags to his tally to end the series with a 1.63 rating.",17-7-2024 19:55,1721238900000
"skullz on joining FURIA: ""It feels like home""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39405/skullz-on-joining-furia-it-feels-like-home,"The Brazilian anchor opened up about leaving Liquid and starting a new chapter in his career. FURIA find themselves staring elimination in the face after day one of the Esports World Cup following a 0-2 defeat to Natus Vincere. The Brazilians almost took the first map, Nuke, to overtime after recovering from an 11-5 deficit, only to falter at the last hurdle. Mirage was a one-sided affair, with FURIA posting only five rounds after a disastrous CT side. After the match, Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros sat down with HLTV to discuss his transfer from Liquid and what went wrong with that team, as well as the feeling to be playing for a Brazilian side once again. You lost 0-2 to NAVI. Mirage didn't go your way at all as you couldn't find a single round on the CT side. What happened? We were a little bit lost in mid-round situations. In the beginning, I think we played pretty good CS, but we are a new team, and, of course, in these little situations, NAVI is going to punish us, because of experience and everything else. So, yeah, I guess that was what happened. Coming into this event, how much time did you have to practice with the team? We had like two weeks of practice, but chelo was sick on some days. He's still sick, very sick. So we lost a few days of practice. So yeah, that's it. I wanted to ask you about leaving Liquid. How would you describe your time there? In your mind, was it an unsuccessful stint, or do you look at it more as an experience? I look at that as an experience, of course. I learned a lot during my period there. And this offer that I got from FURIA was something that I wanted for my career. Because I feel that here I have the freedom to grow a lot more. It was a very happy decision for me, for sure. Why do you think things with Liquid ended the way they did? A lot happened there. We went through a lot. Since the beginning, we didn't have enough ranking points to get into tournaments, so we had to play qualifiers back in LA. So that really messed up our schedule for practice in Europe. And overall, I guess we didn't learn to adapt to each other and play for each other. I think that cost us a lot of time, and we never got into the next stage. The community learned about your move to FURIA before you were benched. How did it all begin? FURIA reached out and Liquid contacted me about the offer. That's how it started. Did you consider any other options for your career? I really think FURIA is the right fit for me for the next couple of years of my career. Maybe in the future, I can play internationally again. But I felt I had to go back to my Brazilian roots to play at my best again and be the old skullz again. Now that you’re back again on a Brazilian team. How much more comfortable do you feel compared to an international roster? It feels like home. I'm really happy to play with these guys. I love them all. They are amazing players and also amazing people. I'm really happy to be here and be part of the scene. What does It feel like to join the biggest Brazilian team with the biggest names? You said you are happy to join FURIA, but does it feel better than the offer you received from Liquid? Kind of, in some ways. I remember that last year I got an offer from them, but it didn't happen because of my buyout. It was pretty high at the time. Since then, I always wanted to play for FURIA. And right now, it just feels like the right time and the right place to be. KSCERATO and yuurih recently extended their contracts with FURIA. Does it reassure you of the team’s future? Yes, of course. They are legendary players in Brazil. And it's going to be really nice to play with them for the next couple of years. FalleN and cadiaN are both AWPing IGLs. But how different are their leadership styles? They are both very good leaders, amazing leaders. But I feel that FalleN gives a little bit more freedom to the players, while cadiaN controls a bit more. I don't think it's a bad way of calling, I want to make it clear. But that's the main difference. And lastly, tomorrow you’ll play the Last Chance stage: BO1 bracket single-elimination for one spot in playoffs. Do you think this format gives you an advantage given you’re a fresh team? It's a very odd format, but yeah, I guess the next stage is going to be a little bit more comfortable for us because of the map pool.",18-7-2024 00:16,1721254560000
FURIA and Sashi stave off elimination in Riyadh,https://www.hltv.org/news/39410/furia-and-sashi-stave-off-elimination-in-riyadh,"FlyQuest and JiJieHao have been sent packing in the Last Chance Stage. FURIA have advanced to the second round of the Esports World Cup's Last Chance Stage after a 13-5 victory over FlyQuest. It's the end of the road for the Australian team, who were made to pay the price for failing to win either pistol round, leaving them with almost no room for error in gun rounds. As for FURIA, the win comes as a much-needed confidence boost, especially after yesterday's disaster on Mirage against Natus Vincere. The Brazilian team jumped out to a 4-0 lead after a solid start to their CT side, but then they gifted their opponents their first round of the game after wasting a 5v3 advantage. Despite struggling to find opening kills, FlyQuest hit their stride and restored parity at 5-5, with FURIA then bagging the last two rounds after some chaotic exchanges. Now playing on the T side, FURIA brute-forced their way through the upper site in the pistol round and held the bomb in a 5v2 situation. FlyQuest still tried to find a way back into the game in gun rounds, but the dynamic duo of Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos and Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato was too good for them to handle. Meanwhile, in the secondary stage, a 1.98-rated performance from Osama ""0SAMAS"" Orabi was not enough for JiJieHao to stay alive in the tournament as the Asian side fell short against Sashi on Ancient. The Danish team were in control for the majority of the first half and picked up nine rounds on the T side. 0SAMAS went on a tear after the side switch and kept JiJieHao in the game with some solid fragging, but their comeback attempt was thwarted before they could even reach double-digits.",18-7-2024 13:49,1721303340000

M80 and The MongolZ are set to face off in the Last Chance Qualifier's semi-finals on the side of the bracket opposite FURIA and Sashi. The Mongolian squad won their opening LCQ match without skipping a beat as Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold tore through MIBR relentlessly and in the end crossed the 2.00 rating threshold with 19 kills in only 15 rounds as he and his team took it 13-2 on Inferno. This puts an end to a nightmarish tournament for the Brazilians, who lost to Spirit in two one-sided maps and then got handed another big defeat by Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren and his men. On the other server it was M80 and Complexity battling in the North American derby. The two teams took to Anubis, where Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou and his men started on the defense and did so in style. M80's newcomer Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson downed three to give his team the pistol round, but Complexity dominated 7-1 before dropping the final four rounds of the half. Complexity then dropped a 5vs2 and allowed M80 to get within striking distance at the half, 5-7. From there on out North America's top team looked discombobulated on the attack and never quite in control. In the end it took one overtime and newcomer Lake to show great potential with a 1.25 rating, as he and his team made it across the finish line in the last round of the first overtime, 16-14. ""We had mountains and mountains of mistakes, it looked like an NA ECL game from both teams,"" a disappointed Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski told Freya ""Freya"" Spiers after the broadcast. ""It's tiring because we haven't been getting better with these types of mistakes, they're too frequent and this is how you lose games,"" he continued. ""Our comms are fine at the beginning of the round and everything, it's just things break down really quickly and we lose rounds that we shouldn't and give away a lot of advantages.""",18-7-2024 15:43,1721310180000

FURIA are through to the final of the Last Chance Stage at the Esports World Cup after a hard-fought victory over Sashi in the second round. It took the Brazilians two overtimes to get this one over the line after letting a massive 10-4 lead slip, and they have Marcelo ""chelo"" Cespedes to thank as he pulled off a crucial 1v2 clutch at 11-11. After moving past FlyQuest and Sashi, Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo's troops must win one more best-of-one game, against either The MongolZ or M80, to enter the EWC playoffs and set up a quarter-final clash against MOUZ. Fresh off destroying FlyQuest on this very same map, FURIA enjoyed a bright start to the game and picked up an early lead off the back of a flawless pistol round. The game became a little scrappy as the first half wore on, with neither team able to stamp their authority on proceedings, but then FURIA stormed to an 8-4 lead after a dominant 4-0 run. FURIA maintained their momentum and added to their lead with another clean pistol round, with Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato demonstrating just how confident his team was as he tried (and failed) to go for a knife kill. Little did he know that the game was about to turn. Sashi took the game to their opponents once they had money to work with and closed the gap little by little until they restored parity at 11-11. With only a few seconds on the clock, chelo came up clutch in a 1v2 situation and put FURIA on match point, but the Brazilians would waste the chance to secure victory in regulation. Sashi fought back from two match points down in the first overtime, but there was nothing they could do to prevent FURIA from winning the match in the second set of extra rounds.",18-7-2024 17:43,1721317380000

A meeting against the No. 1-ranked team in the world, with confidence high from a trophy lift at that event in London, is as much of a test as G2 could have gotten in their debut event with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski. The winner of the match will face Vitality or Virtus.pro, who reside on the same side of the bracket and look revitalized coming out of the break.

Spirit and Virtus.pro have locked in spots in the quarter-finals of Esports World Cup following victories over MIBR and Complexity, respectively, in their opening matches. Complexity went into the tournament break on a high after ending the organization's 14-year LAN trophy drought at ESL Challenger Jönköping, but looked a shadow of themselves upon their return. Individual inconsistency again plagued the roster, with Michael ""Grim"" Wince having a particularly woeful first map and the entire team going missing on Dust2. Their team play also paled in comparison to Virtus.pro, who looked formidable after finally getting some extended practice time with Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov under their belts, which showed as he tallied his best map since joining the team on Dust2 (2.00 rating). The Russian team was the better side in most full gun rounds and looked comfortable by the end of both maps despite losing three out of four pistols and going down 1-5 and 6-9 on Anubis, a map that came as a surprise pick out of Complexity. Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou's side are on a 12-map winstreak on Vertigo and were expected to pick it coming into the series, but opted for Anubis instead. Their six-map winstreak may have inspired internal confidence on it, but it was a favorable choice for Virtus.pro over Vertigo, and the Russian side proved as much with a superior defense that was good for seven rounds in a row. Dust2 was a blowout as Complexity struggled to counter Virtus.pro's early game plan, which moved from abusing B to attacking Catwalk and Long for an 8-4 lead. VP's swap to the defense left no room for a comeback and Complexity were left looking the fool in the series after the one-sided loss. Spirit, who also entered the tournament break on a high after winning BLAST Premier Spring Final, did the opposite of Complexity and delivered a masterclass on Nuke and Vertigo to decimate MIBR in the most one-sided series of the day. The Brazilians mustered only seven rounds combined between the maps as Boris ""magixx"" Vorobiev had a stand-out performance, topping the board with 1.79 and 1.58 ratings to earn his team a dominant victory.",17-7-2024 22:52,1721249520000

Virtus.pro are through to the playoffs while Complexity drop down to the brutal Last Chance stage, where they will meet the likes of FURIA, The MongolZ, MIBR, and Sashi in a cutthroat single-elimination, best-of-one bracket. In the most one-sided encounter of the tournament so far, MIBR were simply no match for Spirit, posting only seven rounds across the series. The Brazilians will fight for survival in the Last Chance Stage, while Spirit enter the playoff stage. Virtus.pro 8-4  Complexity Virtus.pro are ravaging Complexity's defenses, initially focusing on abusing Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery on B before turning attention towards Catwalk and Long. Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov and Evgenii ""FL1T"" Lebedev enjoyed themselves with some early entries and free reign to hunt down saving COL players, who have a monumental task ahead if they want to force an Inferno decider. Virtus.pro 2-1  Complexity That's 3/3 pistols for Complexity in the series thus far, but the two wins they got on Anubis still weren't enough to overcome VP's excellent resurgence. This time is proving no different as Virtus.pro answered right back with a force-buy, a 5vs4 for Complexity falling by the wayside as Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery failed to grab a frag on B and Complexity were left with no nades to retake. Virtus.pro 13-9  Complexity What a disastrous map from Complexity. From a 5-1 lead to 6-6, and then from a 9-6 lead after winning the second pistol to 9-13. That's one to forget for the American team, and particularly from Michael ""Grim"" Wince, who ended the map 2-20. Virtus.pro looked excellent after recovering from slow starts in both halves, re-aggression and excellent trade fragging painting a night-and-day picture between their coordination and their opponents'. Complexity's gamble of Anubis instead of Vertigo failed to pay off, and Virtus.pro's pick of Dust2 is up next as they look for the 2-0. Virtus.pro 8-9  Complexity Spirit 13-4  MIBR A 5-0 run on the CT side seals the deal for Spirit, who ran out comfortable 13-4 winners on their map pick, with Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets and Boris ""magixx"" Vorobiev each racking up 17 frags. We're now headed to Vertigo, MIBR's map pick. Virtus.pro 6-6  Complexity Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou had a hot start to the series, tallying five multi-kill rounds to end the half atop the board, but it was only good enough for Complexity to post six at the break. They looked like they could completely lock Virtus.pro out with a superb 5-1 CT start, but Virtus.pro's methodical defaults picked apart the defenses and allowed the Russian team to go on an identical run to tie the score at the break. Spirit 5-1  MIBR A devastating blow for MIBR. This is the sort of round you cannot afford to lose, not when you're trying to mount a comeback against a team like Spirit. Virtus.pro 0-0  Complexity Vertigo was expected to be in the draw for this series with Complexity boasting a 12-map winstreak on LAN and Virtus.pro usually barely managing to eke out wins, but Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou and company have thrown a curveball and opted for Anubis instead. Complexity have a six-map winstreak on the Egypt-inspired map, but it's a much stronger map for Virtus.pro too. Let's see how the decision works out. The last two best-of-threes of the day are about to kick off. Virtus.pro and Complexity are locking horns on the A stream, while BLAST Spring Final champions Spirit look to carry momentum from before the break into their series against MIBR. Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski and company ended a 14-year LAN trophy drought for the Complexity organization by winning ESL Challenger Jönköping, but their inconsistent form and lack of a consistent secondary rifler to step up alongside EliGE leaves questions around whether they can keep that momentum up. Virtus.pro have been on an upturn since adding Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov, but limited practice with their new addition and a prolonged period of dismal results means they, too, have much to prove coming out of the break. On b1t's Nuke performance: ""I didn't realize at first that he was reaching 30 bombs. The way he was speaking and the way he was communicating, it felt like he was fully in control of the game."" On EWC goals: ""We thought about the opening games and the losers going into this chaotic best-of-ones. Our goal was not to go there, go one game at a time. We thought the opener would be very important. We played from home, we had a bootcamp. We're here to try and play our best CS. We're not here to fool around."" Natus Vincere move on to the quarter-finals at the Esports World Cup with a 2-0 victory over FURIA. The reigning Major champions looked a bit shaky on Nuke but then went up another level on their map pick of Mirage. It's still early days for FURIA, and this match showed they have a lot of work ahead. Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros had some solid rounds, but the same cannot be said for Marcelo ""chelo"" Cespedes, who looked lost and confused in this series. Natus Vincere 12-1  FURIA Natus Vincere 9-0  FURIA It's looking rough for FURIA, who still haven't been able to find a round in this game. Are we heading to a 13-0 blowout? The streak of no upsets continues at EWC as Vitality closed out Dust2 in comfortable fashion to complete a 2-0 sweep over M80. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut was naturally at the forefront of the effort, with Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi and William ""mezii"" Merriman following close behind on both maps as Vitality looked somewhat revitalized after the break. M80 fared well on Vertigo but will lament not converting advantages at the end of the map, and now face a gauntlet run in the best-of-one, single-elimination last-chance bracket if they want to make the playoffs. Vitality 8-4  M80 Vitality have laid waste to M80 for much of Dust2, going up 7-1 on the T side while repeatedly abusing rotations. A 1vs3 clutch from Michael ""Swisher"" Schmid helped M80 tally their second and gave them a window to get back in the game, during which Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson knifed Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut for a moment to remember in his international debut. Vitality have a significant edge going into the second half, though, with a 2-0 looking likely if M80 don't pick up the pistol. Natus Vincere 13-11  FURIA What a tense game on Nuke! FURIA showed incredible fighting spirit and came back from 11-5 down, but mistakes in two key rounds proved costly. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy was the hero of the game with 31 frags as NAVI took the lead in the series. We're now off to Mirage, NAVI's map pick. Natus Vincere 11-9  FURIA All of a sudden, it's a two-round game! Natus Vincere appeared to have the game in the bag after a bright start to their T side, but FURIA are still fighting and have closed the gap to just two rounds, despite some mistakes. Vitality 13-11  M80 It wasn't pretty, but Vitality got the job done to steal M80's Vertigo pick in regulation. Two key rounds at the eleventh hour — a half-buy and hero AK from Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut — were key in halting in M80's momentum in a resurgent second half, with the American-majority side showing their inexperience with Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson as they stumbled at the final hurdle. The 19-yaer-old had a particularly woesome debut and welcome to tier one, posting just eight kills in 24 rounds. We head to Vitality's Dust2 pick next. Natus Vincere 7-5  FURIA A solid CT half from NAVI, who didn't let their opponents string rounds together once they had guns to work with. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy and Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov combined for 30 frags during the first half, with the two-time Major winner also boasting a perfect 3-0 opening duel record. Vitality 11-11  M80 This map has been turned on its head. M80 were looking out of sorts in the first half and only clung on with a fifth round in its closing moments, but another pistol win in the second half and a resolute defense has brought them right back into the game. The closing moments of the map have been thrilling as Vitality converted a half-buy round, only to crumble to this complete eco from M80. A hero AK from Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut in the next brought things right back, however, and M80 are the ones who need to recover. Natus Vincere 4-3  FURIA Natus Vincere seem to be in control of proceedings now on Nuke, off the back of a trio of Famas frags by Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy. The Major champions are starting to build a solid economy, while FURIA had to go on a full eco. Vitality 5-4  M80 A rough go on Vertigo thus far for M80. Three rounds off the back of a pistol win have become a distant memory, and newcomer Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson is struggling immensely. He was kill-less until round nine, when M80 tallied their fourth round in labored fashion after almost giving away a 1vs5 to Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut. The match between FURIA and Natus Vincere, which will mark Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros's debut for the Brazilian, will begin on Nuke, FURIA's map pick. Natus Vincere went for a Mirage pick, while the decider will be Dust2. After the terrifying start that was Nuke and the first half of Ancient, MOUZ looked quite comfortable once they turned up to the server. Mirage was in their control almost from start to finish as they pulled it together with an all-around team victory. They move on to the quarter-finals, while Sashi fall to the resurrection stage. When did he first hear from G2?: ""1998, Kansas. No, I think 2022 after ENCE we had a small talk. When i was in Japan on vacation I then got some messages."" On TaZ: ""I love this guy. He has a really nice Mercedes, he takes us on rides it's great. We have barbecues."" On calling: ""I'm trying my best. A lot of experienced players take a lot of calling. I had a bit more space than in practice, but as a first match with little practice a win is a win. We throw some rounds against glocks and deagles."" On Inferno: ""My experience with Inferno is that Inferno = lose, famous Steam tag group. I don't like this map. But don't worry, Vertigo is coming as well guys."" One of the interviews of all time. Confirms a 2022 approach, Vertigo in the pool, and a Mercedes joke for good measure. Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski is king. The video is well worth a watch. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen to Henry ""HenryG"" Greer on expectations for the Esports World Cup: ""No matter where we are we are here to win, to get to finals and make deep runs, but as I said to the guys we need to rebuild ourselves a bit. ""We ran out of gas in the end of the last season, also played a little bad, so let's just try to ramp up into the season instead of expecting finals all the time. But I wouldn't be surprised if we go all the way to the finals."" ""Welcome to G2, malbs,"" says Janko ""YNk"" Paunović on the desk after G2 squeeze past The MongolZ after an almighty brawl on Inferno. Ecos went both ways, clutches did too, but G2's individuals proved too strong in the end. After being up 5-0 FaZe ran into a wall as FlyQuest finally turned up on the CT side of Nuke, and went on to win the second pistol round to secure a 10-7 lead. Despite getting control of the economy after a botched 5v2, FlyQuest couldn't convert the lead and FaZe went on a dominant streak on the defense to secure the match before it reached overtime again. A massive sigh of relief for FaZe as they survive their first test of the new season. G2 12-13  The MongolZ Overtime on Inferno is delivering the highlights to warrant it's reputation. I can't even remember the last save. MOUZ came agonizingly close to the game running away from them to a degree where a comeback would have been next to impossible, but winning three 3v5s in a span of four rounds allowed them to pick up a solid first half in the end. From there, they had no problems on the CT side and steamrolled Sashi to force a decider. Mirage next. G2 12-12  The MongolZ Chaos as the B pop results in a teamkill on The MongolZ side but in the 1v3 Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren pulls them out of jail. G2 10-11  The MongolZ Four in a row for G2, but all for nought as the A defence crumbles against unarmoured pistols. G2 6-9  The MongolZ Not one for Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač's highlight reel, this. Both teams are trading eco wins after The MongolZ finally won a pistol for 8-5, then lost their anti-eco for 8-6, and now this for 9-6. Two 3v5s and a 2v5 later, MOUZ took the lead and ended up winning six in a row to keep things even on the second map. Still some ways to go, but they've now also picked up the second pistol round to put Sashi on the back foot. G2 3-5  The MongolZ Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren had two key rounds and it's The MongolZ in the lead despite losing yet another pistol. On Ancient their dominance in the gun rounds mattered little after losing 13-11 to a force-buy right at the close, but they've put themselves in a good position here. Sashi 5-2  MOUZ MOUZ are beginning to feel the pressure as Sashi have turned up on the Ancient defense. They've finally gotten on the board in the past couple of rounds, but both had to be hard-fought from a disadvantage, keeping MOUZ on low economy the whole time. G2 1-3  The MongolZ G2 2-0  The MongolZ Inferno now, and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, like he did on Ancient, is taking the 'full' lurk role of Apartments, allowing Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa to keep Boiler. A small tweak, but a tweak nonetheless. A hard-fought Anubis goes the way of FaZe after an overtime affair. Here's the game-ending Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants play, a quad-kill and 1v1 clutch which began with the Latvian on just 20 HP. The Danes secure their own pick 13-11 thanks to a solid CT side to take the series lead. Oliver ""kwezz"" Rasmussen was the man of the map with 23 kills and nine multikills, including an ace in the first pistol round that might just have given Sashi enough rounds on the T side to have a real shot. FlyQuest had it all in their hands when they won the second pistol round, but a forcebuy win starring Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen instantly shifted momentum, and from there FaZe dominated the Aussies on the CT side. In the end, though, FaZe failed to convert two map points and it's going to extra time. G2 need both pistols and 48 frags from Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov but they take Ancient 13-11. Far from convincing. But Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa did all he needed to: He went 4-0 in openers, and turned up with a saved AK-47 in round 24 — when G2 were under real pressure — with a double entry in Middle. G2 11-6  The MongolZ Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov both have 20 kills. The duo combine for 26 kills and eight multi-kills as FlyQuest lead 7-3 on the less favored CT side of Anubis. On the other side, only David ""frozen"" Čerňanský is turning up for FaZe, but even his efforts are fruitless. G2 6-4  The MongolZ G2 5-4  The MongolZ After that flurry of rounds to begin from G2, The MongolZ have been winning the trade battles and the gap is down to one round. Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski has been caught a few times in Cave now, and the fourth most-picked player in fantasy has just one frag thus far. G2 4-0  The MongolZ But it's hard to tell if it matters. Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač is dominating Middle, and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov is 11-1. G2 1-0  The MongolZ Pack it in, roles don't matter after all. Sashi versus MOUZ is the only game that has gone live so far at the event as the other two are racking up delays. But we'll have to wait and see if it remains their permaban, since The MongolZ banned Vertigo first. And there's also a wait for the game: A 9 minute timer has just come up on screen, making it a 20 minute delay to the original start time of 13:30 . Another team who struggled with burnout at the start of summer was MOUZ, who crashed out of IEM Dallas — a tournament they did not even practice for, such was their exhaustion. They open their EWC against Sashi, the Nicolai ""HUNDEN"" Petersen-led side who upset Eternal Fire and Cloud9 in the qualifiers to get here as the 14th seed. One final team to keep an eye on later, as Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros debuts for FURIA. All eyes will be on Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato, however, who rebuffed all international interest to renew for an additional three years at an organization that has consistently performed below his individual level. He'll be out to prove the haters wrong, and it's the Major champions he's up against at 16:45 . Replacing Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa was never going to be easy, and M80 went for a raw talent in the form of Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson to do so. You can learn more about the hyper-aggressive 19-year-old American in this piece from Dust2.us. Tick tock... the new season is here. Sign up here. FaZe have been the best and most consistent team of CS2 so far, but at the back end of last season we started to see some holes in their armor. Their streak of eight grand finals in a row was ended by Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut at ESL Pro League, and they were then eliminated early by Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip's G2 in Dallas and Vitality again at BLAST London. But after a month off, and with time to fix their straining map pool, you'd be a fool to count out Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company. The EWC has a... unique format. We start with these seven best-of-threes in the 'opening stage,' where winners go to playoffs and the losers go down to the last chance bracket. There, they join local qualifier side JiJieHao for a brutal eight-team single elimination bracket to decide the eighth and final playoff team. After that, we have the usual four quarter-finals before a BO3 grand final on Sunday. In case you missed it, we caught up with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa himself to ask him about his long journey out of Guatemalan CS all the way to G2 and playing with Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov. He was also confident of adapting to his new roles, telling us: ""I'm not going to lie, I am doing well laughs. ""There are some habits, like you get the opportunity to re-peek in Connector on Mirage, but you cannot do it when anchoring A on Ancient, for example. ""I'm not perfect, but I haven't made as many mistakes as other people transitioning from a star player to an anchor will do."" G2 were the big story from the off-season, swapping Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković and Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen for Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski. There's no doubt it's a firepower upgrade, but how will they manage to give four riflers used to some star roles enough space? Today is the first indication of how they will solve that puzzle, with malbsMd to anchor big sites and Snax, presumably, on small ones. The tournament begins with three concurrent best-of-threes: MOUZ-Sashi, FaZe-FlyQuest, and G2-The MongolZ.",17-7-2024 22:24,1721247840000

The MongolZ see off M80 to reach LCQ final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39414/the-mongolz-see-off-m80-to-reach-lcq-final,"A single best-of-one against FURIA separates The MongolZ from a spot in the playoffs. The MongolZ are through to the final match of the Last Chance Stage at Esports World Cup after eliminating M80 with a comfortable 13-8 win on Ancient. A best-of-one against FURIA is all that is left for the Mongolian team to complete their run through the brutal knockout bracket, where they demolished MIBR 13-2 earlier in the day. FURIA are a favorable opponent for Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren and company as they have a 3-0 record over the Brazilian organization, seeing to their direct elimination in the Play-in stages of IEM Katowice and Cologne in 2023 and knocking them down to the Play-in lower bracket at Katowice this year. M80 showed signs of promise in the best-of-one, but a lack of experience with Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson — just five days bootcamping in Europe — and a far superior individual showing from The MongolZ made this a clear-cut victory for the Mongolian team in the end. The teams were deadlocked at the start of Ancient, with a pistol win helping The MongolZ lead 3-0 before M80 responded with three rounds of their own, but momentum quickly swung the way of the Mongolian side after Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold prevented a 5vs3 from slipping away with a clutch. M80 won two more rounds on the CT side to prevent a blowout and started chipping away at a 5-9 deficit in the second half, but bLitz stepped up massively in the dying moments of the map to halt any attempt at a comeback effort. He bagged two multi-kills to shatter M80's economy and grant his team match point, which they wasted no time in converting with an aggressive stance in Middle and B Lane.",18-7-2024 19:28,1721323680000
FURIA seal playoff berth over The MongolZ,https://www.hltv.org/news/39415/furia-seal-playoff-berth-over-the-mongolz,"The Mongolians were punished for allowing the Brazilians to steer the veto to Nuke. FURIA have secured a playoff spot at Esports World Cup thanks to a 13-9 victory over The MongolZ on Nuke. Having been sent down to the Last Chance bracket thanks to a loss to Natus Vincere, FURIA kept their tournament dreams alive by beating FlyQuest, Sashi and The MongolZ to bag the final playoff berth on offer. The Brazilians can now look forward to a quarter-final matchup against MOUZ, whilst The MongolZ are sent packing from the tournament. All signs pointed to a The MongolZ victory before the game, as they have beaten FURIA in their previous two meetings and are on an upward trajectory after a strong finish to the first season of the year. The analyst desk sounded warning claxons, however, after the veto was steered towards Nuke, a map FURIA have already played multiple times in Riyadh. The Brazilians took this advantage and ran with it, kicking Nuke off by posting a powerful T side driven by the fragging of Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato. The MongolZ showed glimpses of a potential comeback at the start of their own T side, but when Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros denied a near-3v5 by the Mongolians by preventing the bomb going down, FURIA took back control. skullz popped up with another potent play towards the end of the map, this time a multi-kill hold of Hut, to help seal the deal.",18-7-2024 20:49,1721328540000
"Swisher: ""malbsMd doesn't deserve those roles [in G2], he should be in ones he shines in""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39416/swisher-malbsmd-doesnt-deserve-those-roles-in-g2-he-should-be-in-ones-he-shines-in,"The M80 rifler believes his former teammate deserves the chance to play his favored roles in his new team. M80 were hamstrung coming into the Fall season after losing Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa to G2 during the tournament break. The Guatamalan rifler had been in blistering form in 2024 and deservedly got the call-up, but his departure left a gaping hole in the American team for both firepower and sheer impact. The team looked homeward and added Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson, a blossoming prospect in North America but one entirely untested internationally. With just five days of bootcamp in Europe under his belt, the 19-year-old was thrown into the deep end as he made his international debut against Vitality at Esports World Cup, where M80 narrowly let their Vertigo pick slip and ultimately lost the series 0-2. A comeback against Complexity in the Last Chance Stage saw M80 eliminate their domestic competition, led by a star performance from Lake, but the team struggled to fend off The MongolZ and had their EWC run brought to an early end. HLTV spoke to Michael ""Swisher"" Schmid after M80's elimination to discuss the team's run in Riyadh, the loss of malbsMd and potential of Lake, and how it felt to take down Complexity before bowing out of the event. You just got eliminated from EWC. Considering the change that you’ve made recently, did you have any expectations from this event? You always go into an event with some expectations, but realistically, not very much at all here, especially with Vitality in round one. We knew that Vertigo would be our biggest wildcard against them because they didn't have much practice before the player break and we assumed they didn't practice at all during the player break. We could have won that map, it was in our hands. Beating Complexity was a nice win, and then we could have had this game, we lost both pistols. There was still a big 9-8 round that we could have won that could have swayed the game, but those MongolZ are good man, they fought hard and we fell short. But still a pretty good showing from us. Regarding the Complexity game — it was a close one. How happy are you that you managed to make it go your way considering it's an NA derby? Obviously super happy. I don't think we have ever played them on M80, so that was the first time we've ever played them. We've scrimmed them a ton. Everyone has always asked the question of 'Who is the best team in NA?' and we're like, 'Oh, we're pretty good, we're pretty high up there' and everyone and COL is always like 'LOL.' So it's nice finally playing them and beating them the first time we play them. It's a great feeling, we stayed resilient from being down 7-1, so it's good. Do you think you can double down in a best-of-three against them? You'd hope so. They are a good team, and if it was a different day there was equal opportunity that they beat us in the same way, but I believe so — that we'd them in a best-of-three as well. Maybe not at this current moment due to our map pool being limited with only five days of practice, but give or take a month and I would say yes. Recently, you lost malbsMd to G2. Before it happened, did you expect that he might eventually get signed by a bigger team? It was pretty certain that he was at least going to have eyes on him, like it was donk and him who were first and second for entries kills on statistics leaderboards, having a ton of impact. Obviously we were skeptical whether or not he would be on the team going forward for this next season, so when he gave us the news that he got an offer from G2 and he was going to take it, we were all super happy for him because that's a huge step up. So yeah, we kind of expected it. When you learned about him making the move to G2, what was your reaction considering that later, it was revealed that he would be taking more anchor roles? How do you think it will work out for G2? I'm hoping for the best, especially for him because he is one of the best friends I've ever had, the best teammate I've ever had. He doesn't deserve to be in those roles in my opinion. He should be in the roles that he shines in. I feel like there is a pretty big overlap with him and NiKo, but I think he would have shined in similar roles to what huNter- has on CT side. His T side roles are almost identical so that's where you see him shining more like how you saw him performing with us, but obviously he is going to get less impact and less duels which he excels in, especially anchoring on certain sites. Your team went to sign Lake from M80 who’s an American player. What are your first impressions of playing with him? He is super vocal, which is a big thing. Like in our match against Vitality, he was not having a good game, his very first match ever against a tier-one team on LAN is against ZywOo, he's probably seeing stars. He didn't have a good game, but the biggest thing about him was that his voice never dropped and he was always there, so that's super resilient of him as an individual. He's definitely behind in the tier-one meta of decision-making, utility usage, not panicking in certain situations, so that is just a learning curve that he has to adapt to and he obviously is. He's made big leaps forward and made a lot of good individual plays against Complexity today which led to our win. He's doing good. Is his performance against Complexity reassuring in the team's choice in him, that he has a bright future in M80? Of course. He was playing very well domestically against NA, and I'd never spoken to him before he joined. He had good performances in scrims and stuff, but him putting up the numbers when we needed him to do a star performance against Complexity and step up big in those OT rounds was huge, and that's exactly what we need. I'm not sure how involved you were in the process, but I'm really wondering, was it an obvious choice for your team to get him, or were there other players that the team was considering? I wasn't very involved, but I believe there were a couple of other players that we spoke to that M80 wanted to go with. We went with Lake due to him just being younger, more unknown potential, and being able to grow him as an individual kind of like what we did with Mario malbsMd in our system and have him shine. The few other players we've spoken to, we've kind of already seen what they can potentially bring to a team, and it's kind of that question mark that nobody really knows, so we went with him. You’re playing BLAST Showdown in late August. What are your team’s plans until then? We're going back to NA to play ESL Challenger League. They did something with the system so you can't block out time on the schedule now, they force you to play throughout the system, so we're going to have to forfeit a lot of matches, unfortunately. I don't know why they did this but they did, so we have to go back to NA to play ECL matches to hopefully get first or second and qualify for the next season of ECL. Maybe play one or two qualifiers, look forward to hopefully getting the invite to the RMR in Shanghai, and then travel to BLAST.",18-7-2024 21:46,1721331960000

Live updates from Esports World Cup 2024 day two,https://www.hltv.org/news/39409/live-updates-from-esports-world-cup-2024-day-two,"G2 13-5  Spirit Who predicted that result? G2 were by far the better team across this series, taking their map wins very comfortably and running Spirit all the way on Nuke. Truth be told, G2 made multiple egregious errors on Nuke, and probably should have sealed the series in two maps. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa was a potent entry force throughout, Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač both had a good series, and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski called a blinder on Ancient in particular. Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov wasn't needed, which might be the best part about this G2 performance. If we are being honest, Spirit didn't turn up in usual fashion today. Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia was a solid contributor throughout, other players had halves here and there, but overall this was a Spirit short of their best form. G2 9-3  Spirit G2 have just posted another fantastic T half. They conditioned Middle early, wrenching it away from Spirit time and time again thanks to Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa. Then, with Spirit dedicating resources to try and hold Middle, G2 hit the A bombsite three times in a row with fast executes. It wasn't anything overly intricate, and it was less mid-round focused than G2's previous offensive efforts, but it still worked an absolute treat. G2 6-1  Spirit Things are starting to run away from Spirit here, and G2's utter dominance over Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets is a large part of the problem. G2 3-0  Spirit Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa is showing why G2 picked him up in this series. So much impact, particularly in opening kills on the T side. G2 14-16  Spirit Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov tried his best with some heroics, but Spirit had just enough in the tank to clinch a narrow victory. It got very hectic towards the end of the map, G2 probably could have clinched things but made a few too many mistakes. Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov and Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia stepping up towards the end of the map was utterly vital for Spirit Ancient up next. G2 14-15  Spirit Right clicking is for cowards. G2 12-12  Spirit What a hectic second half. Back and forth, plays and blunders made by either side, and now we need OT to separate these two squads. G2 10-11  Spirit Great work to get into the bombsite, but then G2 flub the afterplant. G2 10-10  Spirit Spirit are throwing in some aggression now, and not just Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets in yard. They battered G2's last buy round with a Lobby crunch, and swept aside the following eco to level the score. G2 8-6  Spirit I smell an upset cooking... Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski rolls back the years to clutch out the pistol, before an Upper hit quickly grabs G2 another. G2 6-6  Spirit G2 were in cruise control early in the half, but Spirit dragged themselves back into the half thanks to some impactful work by Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia and Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets. Spirit are now poised to grab this map and send us to a third. G2 6-3  Spirit G2 were dominant in the early rounds after their successful force, only for Spirit to start stringing together some scrappy round wins. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa decided enough was enough, and his double Deagle helped stop Spirit in their tracks. G2 1-1  Spirit That's one way to react after losing the pistol... Spirit 8-13  G2 G2 were so good on the T side, hitting that flow state and making great mid-round calls. Spirit hauled themselves a little closer to parity on their own T side, with Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov making some tidy plays, but they simply had too much of a mountain to climb. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa was fantastic on the T side, Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač had good moments on both halves, and most suprisingly, Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov didn't have to do too much. Spirit 7-12  G2 The guns came up, and G2 took back control. Five map points ahead for the European squad. Spirit 7-9  G2 Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač probably thought he had this round won for G2, but Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov managed to slip the net with a fantastic timing, and his lurk saved the round for Spirit. Spirit are coming back. Spirit 5-9  G2 Spirit needed to start their offensive half strong to have a chance on Mirage, and they have done so. Spirit 3-9  G2 You'd think G2 were the best team in the world and Spirit had just changed their roster after that half. G2 were default-heavy, allowed their individuals to make plays in the mid round, and it was simply too much for Spirit to handle. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač were potent weapons throughout, finding space and timings repeatedly. Spirit 2-4  G2 G2's very loose approach is working wonders, they are finding timings with ease and trading effectively. Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov has gotten Spirit on the board though, and they followed it up by narrowly denying a Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač 1v3 attempt. Spirit 0-1  G2 G2 have kicked off their T side well thanks to some Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa entry work. Esports World Cup has hit the business end of the tournament, and the first playoff game is a mouth-watering prospect. Spirit managed to end the first half of the year on top of the world ranking, whilst G2 struggled to fulfil their potential and made changes in the off-season. Will Spirit donk on G2, or will Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and company prove their new lineup is ready to make deep tournament runs? FURIA have finally dispelled The MongolZ, and they did so relatively convincingly. The analyst desk questioned The MongolZ's decision to steer the veto towards Nuke, a map FURIA have played multiple times at this event, and the Mongolians were punished for their decision. Another powerful T side was the tonic FURIA needed. Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato drive that T side forwards, whilst Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros helped get the CT side over the line. The MongolZ 9-12  FURIA The MongolZ 7-9  FURIA The MongolZ 4-8  FURIA In the initial gun rounds it seemed The MongolZ were in control, but momentum flipped after FURIA's successful Upper rush with pistols. FURIA consistently overwhelmed their opponents with potent entry work to wrestle away map control, before slowing things down and picking the rotations apart. Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch struggled badly to get into the game, which was a real problem for The MongolZ. Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato, meanwhile, bagged 15 first-half frags. The MongolZ 4-3  FURIA FURIA bagged a converted pistol to start their T side but The MongolZ began to take control when guns came up. The Brazilians just hit their opponents with a powerful upper rush to keep the score close. The final match of the last chance bracket is upon us, a single BO1 separates these two sides from the playoffs. The MongolZ have beaten FURIA the last two times the squads met, at the IEM Cologne Play-in 2023 and the Katowice Play-in 2024. The rosters are different than in either of those previous matches, however, so this game should be a fascinating matchup. M80 could have fought for another upset, but their individuals struggled to match the firepower of The MongolZ in what ended up a comfortable win for the Mongolian side. Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren and Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar were at the forefront of the effort and have earned their team a match against FURIA for a spot in the playoffs, with just one best-of-one separating the teams from advancing. M80 8-11  The MongolZ A pistol win and conversion put The MongolZ ahead at the start of the second half, but M80's midrounds and trading allowed them to come out the better in the first gun rounds and close the gap. The MongolZ almost squandered 5vs3 to allow that streak to keep going, but Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren came up big with this quad kill and the Mongolian team are back in control. M80 5-7  The MongolZ The half started slipping away from M80 after Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold's 1vs2, with The MongolZ finding clean entries to go on a four-round run. Some well-timed re-aggression in Middle helped M80 halt the streak and turn a 4vs4 in their favor, and aggression out of Cave at the start of the next round grabbed them a fifth round to keep the game competitive heading into the break. M80 3-5  The MongolZ A sigh of relief for The MongolZ as they regain the lead. M80 3-3  The MongolZ The penultimate match of the Last Chance Stage is underway with M80 and The MongolZ locking horns on Ancient. See how the veto unfolded below: The Mongolian team ran up a 3-0 start on the T side, but hyper-focus on holding CT in a post-plant led to their demise and has allowed M80 to quickly even the score. Freya ""Freya"" Spiers spoke to Elias ""s1n"" Stein about M80's comeback against Complexity and how Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson's integration into the team is going. On COL comeback: ""For me, this game started really sloppy. We didn't execute our ideas well in the first gun rounds, so we were stuck in some bad rounds and it also felt really bad for us. It was 1-7 and the boys won a 2-on-5, which was basically the turning point for the half because we win an unwinnable round, we had some bad feelings earlier, and then we hype up like, 'Yeah! We got the 2-on-5!' ""I got three more rounds to call, we managed to make it to a 7-5 half, and it's MR12 so a 7-5 half is way better than an 8-4 half, so we went with a good feeling out of the half. I think this was the most important thing. On Lake's impact in games: ""Obviously he is a huge fragger, he has insane raw skill. He didn't have a good game in the first series of this tournament, but one thing that is remarkable is he didn't lose his voice, even though he was down bad and we as a team had a sloppy start. ""I like his confidence, his shooting is incredible, I can send him wherever I want and he will get multi-kills. I just try to set him up perfectly and he has the freedom to do it, if he wants to do something he will do it and I will set up around him."" On how Lake will fare against The MongolZ: ""The Complexity style, they play pretty meta, they have any tactic in the book. MongolZ is a pretty outlier team, they have their own style, so we as a team just prepared to play our own style instead of reading into them since they play a little unusual. It'll be a good game, and Lake when he does what he wants and he is confident in it, he has huge potential."" On whether their style has shifted since malbsMd left: ""Honestly right now we've just slotted Lake in one-for-one and given him the freedom malbsMd also had to do whatever he likes. In the slow rounds we try a bit more of the protocols,  but other than that he has all the freedom in the world. ""It was a one-for-one slot as we only had five days of practice in Europe, so everyone should still feel comfortable because they're playing the same game. Obviously there's the difference of the new player and different voice, but he also has similar roles with a lot of freedom which he feels confident in, and that's what we want to base our start into the season with: confidence."" Sodbayar ""Techno"" Munkhbold spoke in a pre-recorded interview ahead of The MongolZ's match against M80, talking largely about his team's recent form and the state of Asian CS ahead of the Shanghai Major. ""We had a really good player break, and mentally we are relaxed and refreshed,"" the rifler began. ""We're really excited to play our first tournament. I say it every time, that every team's goal is to win this tournament and be a champion, and ours is the same as everyone's. We will do our best."" The 19-year-old also praised Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar as a prodigy in Mongolia and spoke about The MongolZ's early exit from Jönköping, which he pointed to as the reason the team missed out on making the top 10 in the world rankings. Talk then turned to the development of Asia, with Techno revealing more teams are playing in Asia with a third spot at the Major up for grabs. ""Comparing to the last three years, there are a lot of Asian teams who have made it to S-tier/A-tier tournaments. After we made it to Legends Stage at the Major and Asia has three slots in the Major, there are a lot of other Asian teams that have come up in the Asian scene. It's a good improvement and good for our region. ""We are the best Asian team right now, and also in my opinion, the best of all time. But we need to keep competing at tier-one events and at this level."" Two powerful T sides clashed on Nuke, but FURIA had a little more in the tank down the stretch to clinch a hard-fought win. Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos and Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato were a force to be reckoned with in OT, whilst Sashi's fragging waned as the match wore on. FURIA 12-12  Sashi Disadvantaged rounds go back and forth, and we head to overtime. FURIA 12-11  Sashi It sounded like Sashi had started to celebrate early judging by the noise on stream, but Marcelo ""chelo"" Cespedes may well have just saved the game for FURIA. FURIA 11-11  Sashi After taking a 10-4 lead on the CT side of Nuke, FURIA have started to let this game slip away from them. Sashi have been the beneficiaries of some potent entry work by Mikkel ""MistR"" Thomsen and Oliver ""kwezz"" Rasmussen. FURIA 8-4  Sashi Another impressive T side performance coming out of FURIA on Nuke. Initially, the two teams traded highly contested gun rounds, but FURIA were in control during the final stages of the half, behind stellar play from Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato, who finished the half with four multi kills. A defeated Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski highlighted Complexity's mistakes as one of the key reasons for the team's defeat against M80 from an early 7-1 lead on the CT side of Anubis. After dropping a 5vs2 situation while up 7-1 and cruising on the CT side of Anubis, EliGE and company failed to regain their footing and in the end were overtaken by M80 in overtime and eliminated from the Last Chance Qualifier. ""We had mountains and mountains of mistakes, it looked like an NA ECL game from both teams,"" EliGE told Freya ""Freya"" Spiers after the match on the tournament's broadcast. ""It's tiring because we haven't been getting better with these types of mistakes, they're too frequent and this is how you lose games,"" he continued. ""Our comms are fine at the beginning of the round and everything, it's just things break down really quickly and we lose rounds that we shouldn't and give away a lot of advantages."" On X, MIBR star Felipe ""insani"" Yuji delivered a mea culpa for the way the team was eliminated at the Esports World Cup. He averaged a 0.74 rating in Saudi Arabia, the third-lowest LAN rating of his career. ""We lost two matches and we're out of the Esports World Cup,"" he wrote. ""Shameful performance on my part, we played very badly on all maps. Sorry to all those who rooted for us. Now it's about resetting and focusing on the next tournaments because the season just started."" Next month, MIBR will attend IEM Cologne, where they will start in the Play-In stage. M80 16-14  Complexity It took overtime, but M80 clawed back from a 1-7 start to win the North American derby 16-14 and send their compatriots home from the Esports World Cup. MIBR have already earned the title of one of the biggest disappointments of this Esports World Cup. They leave the tournament in last place after averaging a shocking three (!) rounds per map. These were their results: MIBR 4-13  Spirit (Nuke) MIBR 3-13  Spirit (Vertigo) MIBR 2-13  The MongolZ (Inferno) The Brazilian team will have some serious thinking to do before their next LAN event, IEM Cologne. M80 11-11  Complexity Complexity were on the verge of map point in a 3vs2 afterplant defense, but after trades and a fantastic flick by Fritz ""slaxz-"" Dietrich, M80 brought it all the way to an 11-11 tie. MIBR have been knocked out of the Esports World Cup after being thrashed by The MongolZ in a quick Inferno game. Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold was the star of the show, posting a 2.01 rating to power his team to a dominant victory. Next up, the Mongolian team will face the team coming out of the North American derby between M80 and Complexity. M80 5-7  Complexity M80 strung four rounds in a row to revive a chronically bad start to Anubis, keeping their options open for a recovery in the second half as they trail only 5-7. Complexity, going on the T side, are still in a fantastic place to come out ahead in the derby. M80 1-7  Complexity Complexity are clearly superior in the North American derby so far, as they have rushed out to a big 7-1 lead on the defending side of Anubis, the most T-sided map in the pool. M80 won the pistol round off the back of a triple from their newest recruit, Mason ""Lake"" Sanderson, but so far have been hitting a wall since time after time. The MongolZ 6-0  MIBR It's not looking good for MIBR. With Felipe ""insani"" Yuji still looking for his first frag, the Brazilians simply cannot hold their opponents off. Everyone on the Mongolian team is pulling their weight. We could be in for a quick game... JiJieHao 8-13  Sashi JiJieHao played just one map and are now sent home. The brightest takeaway from the map was Osama ""0SAMAS"" Orabi shining for his team with a 1.98 rating and 132.8 ADR in his team's 8-13. defeat. FURIA move on to the next round of the Last Chance Stage after a convincing victory over FlyQuest. The Brazilians controlled the game from the initial exchanges, with Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos leading the way with a 1.94 rating. FlyQuest couldn't post a single round on their CT side, and their inability to win pistol rounds cost them dearly. JiJieHao 3-9  Sashi After winning two 1vs1s in a row against Markus ""Kjaerbye"" Kjærbye to get Sashi well on the way to dominating Ancient on the attacking side, Oliver ""IceBerg"" Berg had to go back to spawn after starting the last round with only his Glock. In the end, the lapse was inconsequential, and the Danes went on to close the half out with a big 9-3 lead. FURIA 5-1  FlyQuest FURIA 4-1  FlyQuest It looked like FURIA were going to extend their winning start after Marcelo ""chelo"" Cespedes found two frags, but FlyQuest somehow managed to turn a 3v5 situation around. Meanwhile, Joshua ""INS"" Potter is once again dealing with mouse issues. Which means we're in for another tech pause... The opening round of the Last Chance Stage will feature a clash between two top-20 teams as FURIA and FlyQuest will square off in a best-of-one game. Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros didn't have the debut he would have hoped for as FURIA lost to Natus Vincere in a two-map series. But in an interview with HLTV, the former Liquid player said that the BO1 format could favor like his, one that hasn't had much time to practice. ""It's a very odd format, but yeah, I guess the next stage is going to be a little bit more comfortable for us because of the map pool,"" he said. The Last Chance Stage will feature the seven losing sides from Day 1 plus JiJieHao, who booked their spot in the tournament via the MENA qualifier. The Asian-majority roster is led by ELEAGUE Major 2017 MVP Markus ""Kjaerbye"" Kjærbye, who recently joined the team alongside Denislav ""dennyslaw"" Dimitrov. JiJieHao have a tough task ahead as they will take on Sashi, who took a map off MOUZ on Wednesday. Eight teams enter the Esports World Cup's Last Chance Qualifier, but only one will survive to reach the tournament's playoffs, where they will be slotted against MOUZ. The single-elimination bracket is made even more cutthroat by the fact that all matches are best-of-ones, including the final. The day's action won't end there, as the first match of the playoffs pitting the new-look G2 and the top-ranked Spirit, is set to take place at 20:00 .",19-7-2024 00:55,1721343300000
G2 topple Spirit in Riyadh to make semi-finals,https://www.hltv.org/news/39418/g2-topple-spirit-in-riyadh-to-make-semi-finals,"Exceptional individual excellence and brutal calls on Ancient saw the first battle between donk and m0NESY go the latter's way. G2 are through to the semi-final of Esports World Cup after securing a convincing 2-1 victory over Spirit, grabbing one-sided wins on Mirage (13-8) and Ancient (13-5) on either side of a narrow loss on Nuke (14-16). G2 were by far the better team throughout the series and could well have taken it in two maps if not for some errors in post-plants and late rounds on Nuke, unforced mistakes that allowed Spirit to recover from a deficit and snatch away a map win. The match had an air of excitement around it as it marked the first time Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets faced off, a long overdue meeting between the players widely considered by most fans as the top two of 2024. We were deprived of the opportunity after visa issues meant the Russian sniper missed his team's match against Spirit at BLAST Premier Spring Final, with the Russian team beating G2 with Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas as a stand-in before going on to win the tournament. Minus an absurd highlight from m0NESY on Nuke, however, neither player stole the show in the series, with donk in particular having a woeful game and tallying his worst series rating since joining Spirit (0.82). Instead, it was Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač who led the way to victory for their side, with the team's sheer firepower on full display as they romped to a third map victory to lock in a semi-final spot on Saturday against the winner of Vitality vs. Virtus.pro. G2 chose Mirage to start the series, a map the Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen-led lineup gravitated away from and lost by significant margins on all three occasions they played it in 2024. However, it was immediately clear that this roster is a whole different beast on it, with their loose defaults and excellent trading obliterating Spirit for much of the first half. malbsMd and NiKo were both potent in that effort, finding timings and drilling Spirit's members to the wall in an overwhelming 9-3 effort on the T side. Spirit capitalized on a pistol win to close that gap, but once guns came up a second time for G2 and m0NESY shut down an A execute, the map was brought to a swift end. Nuke began in similar fashion, a pistol win from Spirit giving them little advantage after G2's Deagles ripped them apart in the next round. G2 went up 5-1 before Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia and donk found late-round openings to bring their team back into the game, evening the score to 6-6 heading into the side swap. A vintage 1vs3 clutch from Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski put G2 back in control and they pushed up to double digits, 10-6, only for donk to come alive Outside and begin a late resurgence. Intense mid-rounds unfolded with early advantages from Spirit being recovered by G2, only for their post-plants to crumble and give the Russian team the round. Spirit couldn't convert upon a 12-11 lead, however, and needed overtime to claim victory, where a resurgent performance from a rather quiet m0NESY wasn't enough for G2 to close the series in two despite an incredible highlight 4K. Ancient was the playground on which malbsMd stomped his authority over G2 at ESL Pro League and likely played a part in his move to the roster, and he did much the same to Spirit here. He ran rampant in Middle to condition Spirit into fighting hard for it, and exactly when they did, Snax called three back-to-back A site executes that perfectly countered the adjustment and gave G2 a runaway 9-3 lead halftime. donk had a particularly woeful map and couldn't get much going, sitting up zero kills seven rounds in, a stark contrast to his counterpart in NiKo who looked back to his best throughout the series. Despite it being the first match between m0NESY and donk, the Russian sniper was barely needed and recorded just nine kills on the decider map as his team did the work to close things out.",19-7-2024 01:30,1721345400000
Live updates from Esports World Cup 2024 day three,https://www.hltv.org/news/39420/live-updates-from-esports-world-cup-2024-day-three,"FaZe's tournament results since winning IEM Chengdu: ESL Pro League Season 19: 5th-8thIEM Dallas: 5th-6thBLAST Premier Spring Final: 5th-6thEsports World Cup: 5th-8th FaZe 12-16  Natus Vincere A flawless OT for Natus Vincere is more than enough to get them over the line and into the semis in Riyadh. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy had a fantastic series and put up a 1.36 rating across the series, while none of the FaZe individuals really showed up. FaZe 12-12  Natus Vincere It's not over yet! Natus Vincere won the final round of regulation after an effective upper-site attack. FaZe 11-11  Natus Vincere Six out of the last seven rounds, and FaZe are back in it once again. Can they bring it over the line this time? FaZe 5-8  Natus Vincere Not the best way to play a 4v2, but Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy did enough to save his team from embarrassment. FaZe 5-7  Natus Vincere Natus Vincere turned the tide after Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov's 4k and took the half 7-5. The Ukrainian AWPer kept up his impact all throughout and leads the way with 11 kills. FaZe 3-1  Natus Vincere FaZe 10-13  Natus Vincere Natus Vincere have just about done it. In the end, it came down to a crucial 3k by Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius, who had a quiet map up to that point. The Lithuanian found two crisp Deagle headshots and ended the round by besting Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen in the 1v1, and helped Natus Vincere take the series lead. FaZe 10-11  Natus Vincere From 5-11, FaZe came back into the game in classic fashion. A 1v1 clutch by Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants kept their momentum going on early on, and Robin ""ropz"" Kool has started to find impact. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen is still leading the way with 20 kills, though. FaZe 5-10  Natus Vincere Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen is topfragging, which is never a good sign for FaZe, as two of their stars have gone missing in the series. Natus Vincere have just reached double digits, and FaZe are down to an eco in the next. FaZe 5-7  Natus Vincere Natus Vincere have taken a slender two-round lead into the second half thanks to another great performance by Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy, who put up 104 ADR. On the FaZe side, Robin ""ropz"" Kool and Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard are yet to activate. FaZe 0-1  Natus Vincere Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard was almost gifted a 1v3, but Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius ended the Norwegian's attempt with a quick headshot. On his form: ""I want to get back into the groove of wanting to destroy my opponents."" On b1t's performance: ""He really wants to win, and he's back. He has a fire inside him that came back."" On Dust2: ""B1ad3 has played this map for the whole of his career. It's a simple map, but if you overcomplicate it you can lose the map."" On FaZe: ""You can't let them play their own game and need to play aggressive."" Despite the loss, Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo was satisfied with FURIA's performance in Riyadh, and he also talked about Neymar's presence in the arena. ""He enjoys playing CS in his free time, he has been like that for a couple of years. I wish we gave him the chance to crush their key, that would have been an awesome moment,"" the Brazilian legend said about the post-match ritual of crushing your opponent's key at EWC. MOUZ march on to the semi-finals of the Esports World Cup with a 2-1 victory over FURIA. Despite losing their map pick of Mirage, MOUZ kept their cool and dismantled the Brazilians on Inferno. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek's troops will take on the winner of the series between Natus Vincere and FaZe in the semi-finals, on Saturday. MOUZ 7-3  FURIA It's the second 1v2 clutch from the Brazilian player, who is keeping FURIA in this game! MOUZ 3-1  FURIA Just two days after being destroyed by Natus Vincere on Mirage, FURIA put in a much-improved performance to beat MOUZ in a close game. MOUZ quickly reached double digits after the side switch, but FURIA's defense was nearly impenetrable throughout the half, with the Brazilians dropping only one gun round as CTs. We're now headed to Inferno. MOUZ 7-5  FURIA Just like on Nuke, MOUZ improved as the first half wore on and went into the break up by two. FURIA were unable to string gun rounds together, and now they have a very difficult task ahead on the CT side. MOUZ 4-3  FURIA FURIA have been put on the back foot after losing two rounds that should have been in the bag. First, they lost a 4v2 advantage against Ludvig ""Brollan"" Brolin and Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo. Then, they wasted a 4v3 post-plant situation. Can the Brazilians keep their cool and fight back? MOUZ take the lead in the series with a comfortable victory on FURIA's map pick of Nuke. The Brazilians started brightly but flamed out quickly, with Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato cutting a frustrated figure in this game, Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo was MOUZ's main X factor in this game with a stunning 122 ADR and a 23-9 score. MOUZ 12-6  FURIA MOUZ 7-5  FURIA All of a sudden, MOUZ have managed to get a firm grip on the game. Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo powered his team to a two-round lead with some incredible numbers: 18 frags, seven multi kills and a whopping 148 ADR... MOUZ 1-5  FURIA It's been a rough start to the game for MOUZ. They lost two of the initial three rounds of the game to Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros clutches, and then lost the first full gun round in a 5v3 situation. After finally getting a round on the board, MOUZ lost to a weaker buy. Without too much surprise, FURIA went straight for a Nuke pick. It's the only map that they played yesterday in the Last Chance Stage, beating FlyQuest, Sashi and The MongolZ. MOUZ played Nuke on the first day of the Esports World Cup, losing to Sashi in a close 13-11 game. The second map of the series will be Mirage, where FURIA were destroyed by Natus Vincere on Wednesday, while the decider will be Inferno. On playing Nuke three times in the Last Chance Stage: The last game, I was pretty surprised. We all were. We are showing some great results on it and we're very confident on it. On his adaption to FURIA: Since the beginning, they have been doing an amazing job at making me feel comfortable, giving me some space and the freedom to speak up a bit more. siddee has known me since I was little. He makes me feel very comfortable and very confident. On facing MOUZ: I feel really confident in this matchup. The last time we faced them, I was on Liquid. I feel it's a different story here. We have a very strong map pool right now. I feel very confident. On loss against VP: ""We didn't play our best, we didn't have the energy to fight them after the first map. We lost a lot of 5v3s in this series, they screwed us up a bit."" On VP's new playstyle: ""You have to give them credit, they played with our rotations. They do feel different now, they have a lot more spiciness now. The individuals are so sharp, they have elevated their game with electronic."" On what they need to improve: ""Not to lose advantageous situations. We need to regain our form because we just don't hit the headshots like we used to."" Vitality 5-13  Virtus.pro Just one round on the CT side for Vitality, who looked visibly second best on the Dust2 decider. Virtus.pro now move on to the semi-final, where they will face off against the new G2. Vitality 4-9  Virtus.pro Five alive for Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali and company on the pistol, and that gives them a seemingly straightforward route to the semi-final. Vitality 4-8  Virtus.pro It all began with an unlikely retake of the B bombsite, and it was enough to usher forth a handful of CT rounds for Vitality. They still have much to do in the second half, but they need to break their streak of five lost pistol rounds in this series. Vitality 6-1  Virtus.pro Vitality are floundering on CT side again. They are being constricted by Virtus.pro's map control, losing the opening frag, then crumbling under Virtus.pro's decisive hits. This could be very one-sided. Vitality 7-13  Virtus.pro If Virtus.pro's CT side looked a little shaky, Vitality's literally couldn't stand straight. Not a single defensive round for Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire and company. Neither team had much fun holding B, but Vitality suffered worse. It wasn't as if Vitality didn't have chances, they got man-advantages multiple times, but they were completely lost in mid-round scenarios and Virtus.pro took full advantage. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut tried his best with some heroic multi-kills, but no other Vitality player managed more than 50 ADR. Vitality 7-8  Virtus.pro Virtus.pro almost faltered against a force-buy, but Evgenii ""FL1T"" Lebedev rescued them once again. Vitality 7-5  Virtus.pro Vitality will feel they should have walked away from that half with more rounds. Virtus.pro relied on hero multi-kills or gimmick stacks and pushes for their CT rounds. Vitality still managed to flub a few favourable moments due to messy trading and spacing, but overall were the much better looking side. Vitality 3-4  Virtus.pro Another messy map. Virtus.pro are gambling a lot on the CT side and getting it wrong more often than not, but Vitality have suffered from a couple of messy moments in terms of spacing and trading. Vitality 22-20  Virtus.pro This game was all over the place. Both teams were throwing man-advantage rounds, both teams squandered strong starts to halves, and in the end it was Virtus.pro who made the final mistake. Evgenii ""FL1T"" Lebedev made some monster plays in OT to keep his team alive, but it wasn't enough. Vitality 18-18  Virtus.pro Virtus.pro might have changed up their playstyle, but they still like the long games. Vitality 15-15  Virtus.pro After a three-round T side set Vitality up for success, Evgenii ""FL1T"" Lebedev decided he wasn't quite done with this game just yet. Vitality 12-12  Virtus.pro A hard-fought map so far. Most players on the server have had moments and have contributed impact, and there is little to separate the two squads right now. Vitality 11-12  Virtus.pro A few too many mistakes from Vitality in this half. Some poor pathing onto the A site lost them the previous round, and a missed smoke has just cost them another. Vitality 11-10  Virtus.pro Vitality 8-8  Virtus.pro Vitality 7-5  Virtus.pro Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali might not be built for the hold-W lifestyle, but it still bore fruit for Virtus.pro overall as they manage a five-round offense. Vitality's struggles this year have generally been in mid-rounds, but Virtus.pro's up-tempo and simplistic approach rarely let proper mid-rounds play out. Vitality 5-3  Virtus.pro Vitality 3-3  Virtus.pro Virtus.pro are opting for a VERY up-tempo T side approach, a rarity for them. It seems Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov is having some impact. Virtus.pro got a lead off the pistol, but they are now being dealt with handily by Vitality since guns game up. Kicking off the day's action is Vitality vs. Virtus.pro, and it promises to be a fascinating matchup. Virtus.pro seem to be getting their feet under them with Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov among their number, having bagged a top four finish to end last season and opened their account in Riyadh with a dominant victory over Complexity. In said victory, electroNic was in peak form. Vitality meanwhile had an underwhelming first half of the year, failing to win a single title and in general struggling to find their best form in playoff showings. They are still an elite squad, make no bones about it, but Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi and Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's drop off in playoff games has prevented them from matching the exploits that saw them named 2023's team of the year. Virtus.pro bagged a win over Vitality at BLAST Premier Spring Final, the most recent tournament prior to the player break, although it was a hard-fought victory that required the Russians to come from a map down and battle for their two map wins. Likely the most one-sided quarter-final on paper, plenty will be expecting to see MOUZ breeze past FURIA in their bout later today. MOUZ are one of the world's best sides right now, won a couple of titles towards the back end of last season, and are ranked No. 3 in the world. FURIA are sat at a lowly No. 18, have struggled for some time to compete with the elite, and have a new player to embed. However, MOUZ ended last season with a shaky performance in Dallas and dropped a map to a No. 32-ranked Sashi earlier in this very tournament. FURIA meanwhile seem to have had new life breathed into them by the signing of Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros, but have relied heavily on Nuke as their favoured battleground. When these two sides met earlier this year in Chengdu, MOUZ took what was a surprisingly hard-fought series win. Will MOUZ bag another victory today? This matchup has become a bit of a classic in recent times, with these two squads having contested some banger matches across the last couple of years. FaZe clinched a couple of hard-fought series wins over Natus Vincere to claim the PGL Major Antwerp and IEM Cologne titles back in 2022, the match in Cologne being a 3-2 victory that went down in the history books as one of the best series in CS:GO history. More recently, Natus Vincere took down FaZe at PGL Major Copenhagen to bag the Major title, claiming some revenge for the organization's painful losses in 2022. Natus Vincere also beat FaZe at BLAST Premier Spring Final, meaning Natus Vincere's last two title-winning campaigns included wins over FaZe. Across 2024 in general, Natus Vincere have the edge: The inaugural Esports World Cup hit the playoff stage yesterday and did so with a bang, as G2's new lineup grabbed an upset win over Spirit to book a semi-final spot. Six teams will be vying today to join G2, with four of those teams currently ranked among the top five, and another ranked at No. 7. The best of the best are competing for the title in Riyadh, and today promises to be an action-packed set of games.",19-7-2024 12:28,1721384880000
"sidde: ""I always had the dream of working with skullz again""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39419/sidde-i-always-had-the-dream-of-working-with-skullz-again,"FURIA made it through the last chance gauntlet with new coach sidde at the helm. After a dreary first half of 2024, FURIA elected to make changes as the player break approached, removing long-time member Andrei ""arT"" Piovezan and briefly making use of FURIA Academy player Kayke ""kye"" Bertolucci before acquiring Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros from Liquid. Changes didn't only affect FURIA's starting five, as coach Nicholas ""guerri"" Nogueira elected to move into a new position within the Brazilian organization, taking on the role of Head of Esports. Taking up his mantle in the head coach position was Sid ""sidde"" Macedo, previously the team's assistant coach. The new-look FURIA have enjoyed a solid debut at Esports World Cup 2024, recovering from an opening BO3 loss to Natus Vincere with three successive BO1 victories over FlyQuest, Sashi, and The MongolZ, earning them a place in the quarter-finals of the event. Shortly after his team secured their playoff spot in Riyadh, sidde spoke with HLTV regarding his transition into the role of FURIA's head coach, his experience working with guerri and Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo, his role in bringing skullz into the team, and his thoughts on the team's impending matchup versus MOUZ. You have made your way through the last-chance stage, a cutthroat bracket. Does it feel like a relief to make your way to the quarter-finals? Yeah, definitely does. We knew that if we lost the first match we would have a really hard way to make it into the playoffs, but we always believed that we could make it and I'm really happy that we did it. Today's matches were on the stage. What are your impressions of the arena? I believe this is the first event of this scale in your new role. Yeah, that's my first event being on the stage. Everything feels so good. I feel like the acoustics are really good, people came to watch and did a really good job of cheering for us which made me pretty happy. It was nice seeing them cheer for us. The arena seems really cool. I mean, we want to see it when it's full, but people came here today and they cheered for us and that made me happy. I feel like everything went really smooth with the arena, yeah. You were the assistant coach of FURIA for some time. Can you tell us how you joined the team, and what you have been doing in your previous role? Before I joined, I was working with some regional teams from Brazil. FURIA was my first time working with a team that competed in international tournaments. I was working in Brazil, guerri found me working there. He saw what I did and he told me I did a good job, and he wanted me to be part of the FURIA project because they had just gotten rid of the former assistant coach. He found me, and he told me it would be good to have me because he saw some potential in me. Since I joined, I have been helping the team with preparations and basic stuff for day-to-day things, like helping with prac notes and helping the team get better in some situations, basically the same job any other assistant coach does. I have been working really close with guerri which helped me make the transition into the new position. When you got the offer to become the main coach, was it something you expected to eventually come, like a promotion that was meant to happen? Yeah, this is actually something that was planned by guerri. Our first talk, he mentioned that one day this could happen because he saw that someday he would be leaving the position to try some more important stuff inside the organization in a different position. He told me, there's a possibility one day this happens. When I got the news, it was really cool. He told me that it was closer than ever to happening, so he told me to prepare, and we started a transition process. During that transition, I started talking more and having more space to help the team. We did it in a good way, that I feel really comfortable in this position. How does it work with guerri being the Head of Esports in FURIA? How is he involved with your team and with your work? He talks to us all the time, he wants to see how the team is doing. I think he is doing the same work with every lineup inside FURIA. He wants to have access to stats, and how we do on the day-to-day, the routine, the scrims, how the bootcamps are going, and things like that. He's always in touch with us, he wants some updates to see if the team is working in a way he thinks is right, so he still has a lot of impact on the entire organization, not just the CS team. He's trying to spread the culture he created inside the CS team to the entire organization. Do you feel like you're a successor of guerri, continuing his work and his philosophy, or do you feel like you have something new to introduce? I mean, I have a lot of new ideas to bring to the team. Of course, I learned a lot with him, and it was really important for me to learn with him. I think that made me a more complete coach, I would say. A lot of the things he did, I still do, but I'm definitely bringing my own touch to the team, and the way I see things is mainly how we are going to operate now. But I have a big influence from him, because I learned a lot, and it was a big pleasure to be able to work with a guy who is as successful as him. You joining the team coincided with the introduction of skullz. How do you feel about it? Is it more exciting to be part of the project at this moment, or does it bring new challenges? I love the fact that he is here with me, because we've worked together. Three years ago I had an opportunity to work with him in Brazil, and we became big friends. He's my friend for life, and I've always had the dream of working with him again, and I'm really happy this happened in FURIA now. I was the one who gave the organization the idea of bringing him in because I already knew him and how much he could add to the team and how much of the impact he could add that we were lacking. I feel like he was the right addition, and I'm really happy to have him with me. FalleN is obviously the veteran, one of the biggest names in Brazilian Counter-Strike history ever. There have been talks regarding the authority structure of the team; do you feel comfortable in terms of having your voice heard? I feel one hundred percent comfortable because I've been working with FalleN for the past twelve months, so I know how he thinks and I know how he operates. It's not about him having all the power, but he has a lot of influence in the team, and in the ideas, he's a true leader. He will always have a big voice. But he's an easygoing guy, it's easy to talk to him and reflect on ideas with him, and he's always open to new ideas. That's one of the things that makes him a big leader. He's always listening, and it's really easy to work with him, so I feel one hundred percent comfortable. I feel like I can bring all my ideas to the team and to him and we will always get to a middle ground, maybe on my idea sometimes he'll pass, maybe his, but we are always in a good position to talk and to get to the final conclusion of what we should be doing. Tomorrow you play MOUZ; what do you think of your chances of winning that game? I mean, being completely honest here, they are the clear favorites here, but we have a lot of chances of winning against them because we have been on a really good streak. I feel like this fires up our team big time, we always tend to perform well when we are on a win streak. I feel like they are the favorites, but of course, we have big chances, we are going to do good preparation against them. Last time we faced them in an arena, it was a similar environment, and we managed to win in Finland last year. I like our chances against them, and I feel like it will be a good match.",19-7-2024 14:46,1721393160000
Virtus.pro punish Vitality's poor CT sides to grab EWC semi-final berth,https://www.hltv.org/news/39421/virtuspro-punish-vitalitys-poor-ct-sides-to-grab-ewc-semi-final-berth,"Vitality managed a measly four defensive rounds across the last two maps of play. Virtus.pro have bagged a semi-final spot at the Esports World Cup thanks to a 2-1 victory over Vitality, recovering from a close loss on Mirage (20-22) with comfortable wins on Inferno (13-7) and Dust 2 (13-5). The Russian squad can now look forward to a semi-final bout with G2, whilst Vitality exit the tournament in 5th-8th place. Vitality came into this tournament after a disappointing first half of the year, and they continued to struggle today. Fragging power was virtually non-existent outside of Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut, and poor mid-round play regularly cost them rounds. Virtus.pro, meanwhile, seem to be hitting their stride with Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov on the roster. Their T sides overwhelmed Vitality across the series and were more varied than with past iterations of the roster, and they were very potent in pistol rounds. Mirage was a hard-fought and scrappy affair, with the result coming down to who made the final mistake. Virtus.pro were guilty of regularly suffering untradeable deaths, whilst Vitality often fell apart in mid-rounds and gave up advantages. There were some powerful plays made by players from both teams amongst the chaos, with Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire cooking up a wonderful 1v4 clutch whist Evgenii ""FL1T"" Lebedev kept his team in the map in overtime with back-to-back 4k rounds. Ultimately, Virtus.pro made a blunder in the third set of overtime rounds that cost them Mirage, Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali suffering one of the aforementioned untradeable deaths with time low, but the map could easily have gone either way. Inferno and Dust 2 were both comfortable victories for Virtus.pro thanks to two woeful Vitality CT sides. On Inferno, Vitality couldn't manage a single CT round despite grabbing multiple man-advantages, falling apart regularly in mid-round scenarios, whilst on Dust 2 they lost opening kill after opening kill and couldn't recover. Vitality were certainly not helped by losing all six pistol rounds played, but their CT woes were the deciding factor in this series.",19-7-2024 17:20,1721402400000
PARIVISION round out roster with alpha,https://www.hltv.org/news/39422/parivision-round-out-roster-with-alpha,"The Russian organization has found a new IGL for the Fall season. PARIVISION have announced the signing of Daniil ""alpha"" Demin as the squad's in-game leader, completing a summer revamp that also included the appointment of Ivan ""F_1N"" Kochugov as coach. The organization lost Andrey ""Jerry"" Mekhryakov in May after the Russian IGL stepped down due to burnout and found his replacement in 19-year-old alpha, who most recently represented Spirit Academy. He also led Cloud9 in the Esports World Cup 2024 Europe Closed Qualifier, but the Russian squad couldn't secure a spot at the Saudi event following two losses to Sashi. The youngster finished the event as the highest-rated player on his team, however, putting in a 1.07 rating in eight maps. PARIVISION will hope their latest addition can help them make it out of the lower reaches in the rankings, as they peaked at 46th place in the world ranking before falling to the 66th spot after Jerry's removal. Their first test will come at Skyesports Championship 2024, set to be played from July 23-28, where they have been placed in Group A alongside the likes of The MongolZ and BLEED.

HEROIC have announced Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck's contract extension until 2026 in a humorous Twitter/X announcement. The 25-year-old joined HEROIC in 2021 and has won four titles with the organization, the latest of which came at the BLAST Premier Spring Final 2023. At the end of that year, HEROIC's Danish roster came to an unceremonious end, with only  sjuush and René ""TeSeS"" Madsen remaining in the lineup. sjuush follows his compatriot in signing a two-year contract extension.

Jimpphat shines as MOUZ defeat FURIA to lock in EWC semi-final spot,https://www.hltv.org/news/39424/jimpphat-shines-as-mouz-defeat-furia-to-lock-in-ewc-semi-final-spot,"The Finnish superstar ended the series with a stunning +33 K-D and a 1.61 rating. MOUZ are through to the semi-finals of the Esports World Cup thanks to a 2-1 victory over FURIA in the first round of the playoffs. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek's troops set up a semi-final showdown against either Natus Vincere or FaZe on Saturday as they chase their third trophy of 2024. The world No.3 team left it late to book their place in the semi-finals after surprisingly wasting a 10-5 lead on their map pick of Mirage, which siuhy attributed to his ""awful"" calling on the T side. ""I let them down that game,"" he would say in a post-match interview. Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo was once again the star of the show, topping the scoreboard for his team on all three maps to take his tournament rating to 1.55 and stake his claim as a strong MVP candidate. FURIA were outclassed on Nuke and Inferno, but there should still be a lot of positives to take from this series and their Riyadh run as a whole. It's still early days for the roster, but Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros appears to be getting on well with his new teammates and had numerous impactful clutches throughout this series. This quarter-final run should give them a platform to build on ahead of IEM Cologne. ""This tournament was very important for us,"" Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo said after the match. ""If we didn't do well here, there was a chance we would have to go back to Brazil to qualify for some tournaments. The fact that we had a good run here is going to help us have more practice time."" The Brazilians, keen to extend their winning streak on Nuke, began the series with intent and raced out to a 4-0 lead on the T side after a couple of skullz clutches in the early rounds and a 3v5 win in the first full gun round. It looked like MOUZ were struggling to keep pace and gain any rhythm against their opponents, but then they finally hit their stride and went on a 7-1 run, behind some impressive rounds from Jimpphat, who ended the half with an 18-6 score and a 148 ADR. The Finnish player added two more kills to his tally as MOUZ picked up the following pistol round with ease. FURIA's spirits were briefly lifted as they won the third round with MP9s, but MOUZ quickly regained control of the game and put the map to bed. Mirage followed the same pattern as the previous map as FURIA hopped out to an early lead, only to lose control of the game once MOUZ had guns to work with. The European team quickly hit double digits after switching to the T side, but all of a sudden they lost some steam. With Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos and Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato leading the charge, FURIA went on a dominant 8-1 run to secure victory and take the series to Inferno. MOUZ came out looking revitalized and sharp as they cruised to a 9-3 lead on the CT side - and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided if skullz had not won two 1v2 clutches. FURIA found a lifeline in the second half by winning the pistol round, but their comeback hopes would be crushed instantly as MOUZ pulled off a successful force-buy and quickly won the final three rounds they needed.",19-7-2024 21:16,1721416560000
b1t powers NAVI past FaZe at EWC,https://www.hltv.org/news/39426/b1t-powers-navi-past-faze-at-ewc,"Aleksib and company have made the last-four stage in Riyadh. Natus Vincere have defeated FaZe in a two-map series (Mirage 13-10, Nuke 16-12) in the Esports World Cup 2024 quarter-finals. FaZe will rue their slow starts, as they found themselves 5-10 down on both maps before they began their comebacks, but it proved too little too late on both occasions. ""We knew we might lose a few rounds here and there, but this result shows we have some depth to our game,"" said a joyous Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen in the post-match interview. Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy's troops will now face off against MOUZ in the semi-finals on Saturday. For FaZe, this is a disappointing start to the season. The European combine ended the year with quarter-final exits at ESL Pro League, IEM Dallas and BLAST Premier Spring Final, and Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company have now once again been eliminated in the same stage. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy began the series in hot form to help Natus Vincere take an early lead, but karrigan answered with a high-fragging performance to return FaZe into contention. After a back-and-forth first half, Natus Vincere ran away to an 11-5 lead before FaZe started their comeback attempt. They got up to ten rounds, but the map came down to a crucial 3k by Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius, who was having a quiet game up to that point. The Lithuanian found two crisp Deagle headshots and ended the round by besting karrigan in a 1v1 to help Natus Vincere take the series lead. Nuke began with a FaZe pistol before a 4k by Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov's saved AK-47 turned the tide and allowed them to take another 7-5 lead. They soon extended that lead to 10-5, but FaZe's resilience meant that the map moved to overtime. Once there, Natus Vincere found a second wind to pick up four rounds in a row, during which b1t found seven kills to ensure Natus Vincere's victory.",20-7-2024 00:18,1721427480000
"electroNic: ""You can't only play a slow style; we have almost found the balance""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39427/electronic-you-cant-only-play-a-slow-style-we-have-almost-found-the-balance,"VP have reached the semi-final in the first event of the fall season. Virtus.pro completed the blockbuster signing of Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov in place of Nikolay ""mir"" Bityukov after the Copenhagen Major, but a busy schedule meant the team couldn't develop their playbook until the player break. During their time off, they also added Andrey ""Xoma"" Mironenko as head coach in place of Dastan ""dastan"" Akbayev in a move that seemed to signal an even bigger departure from their slow and calculated playstyle. Early signs of the change are good, as Virtus.pro beat Complexity and Vitality to make the semi-final at the Esports World Cup, where they will face off against G2. After the win against Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's troops, electroNic sat down with HLTV to discuss the team's campaign in Riyadh, their decision to add Xoma, and the new G2 and Cloud9 rosters. Editor's note: electroNic's answers in this interview were translated by Russian-speaking HLTV staff. We're at the Esports World Cup with electroNic. Your team just played against Vitality. On map one, you almost got the game to another overtime, but in the 1v2 situation, when planting for connector, mezii managed to get the frag, and you ran out of time. What do you think went wrong in that round? Was this situation just a risky play due to the lack of info, or was a mistake made? We definitely could have played that round better. If we take that specific 1v2 situation, I think I shouldn't have run to spawn, I should have tried to find him, remain in the connector, and help. I chose the wrong actions, and we lost the round because of that. It is what it is, what can I say? But in the end, you won the game 2-1. What are your impressions? Did the game go according to your expectations? Yes, of course, we practiced a lot for this tournament and had good preparation. That is why we did what we planned to do, and it worked out pretty well for us. So I think that they just played into our game. Recently, you have replaced dastan with Xoma as the coach. dastan worked with Jame for a long time, and that changed after you joined the team. Is it a coincidence? Probably it's a coincidence, I can't comment on this. The only thing that I can say is that what happened, happened. They worked together for quite a while, and the organization probably wanted to try something new. If people think that I came and did this, they're deeply mistaken. I'm not one of those people who join and want changes straight away... I'm just enjoying the team. I'm the new guy, just getting used to it, so it is what it is. Xoma is your new coach. Were you involved in hiring him? If so, what convinced you to go for this option? First of all, it probably needs to be said that Xoma deserved to get a chance to be in the tier-one scene. He did quite well and had success with 9 Pandas. He proved to be a person who can build the process quite well, I think this is why they picked him. I don't know, to be honest. It's better to ask the organization or Jame. When Xoma was coaching 9 Pandas, I noticed that he was very emotional, yelled a lot, and tried to motivate the team. Is it important and needed in your team? I think so. It's always cool when people cheer for you and you feel their support. So I think it's a plus rather than a minus, no one complains. Everything is okay in that sense, yeah. Jame recently said that Virtus.pro needs to rebuild their system accounting for your signing. Are you happy with the way this process is going? I don't want to share details on how it's going, but there are things that I, perhaps, can do better than the previous players of this team in the same roles. So we can change our style, and, consequently, I think we are at the stage where we can easily find the balance. We have almost found it, and everyone is more or less happy about where we're going and how we're getting there. Speaking of the changes in your play, I noticed that Virtus.pro now has more fast rounds on the Mirage T-side. What can you say about this? We're probably trying to play like all teams do. You can't only play a slow style, and we're trying to combine it so it's easier to play around the map, let's put it like that. Your roster is now three months old. Do you think you've had enough time to overcome the starting stage and start progressing? Let's start with the fact that we had very little practice before the player break. We had little time, we had three or four events in a row. Plus, I was working on some visa things, which is why we could not fully practice. So no, we managed to practice quite well only after the break. We had some time to get to feel our game. As you said, you had a long series of events indeed. You probably had an opportunity to rest during the break. Did you use it? And how important was that for the team to have some rest? I will say for myself that I didn't really rest, I had a lot of things that I needed to take care of during the break. But the rest of the team rested, they are fresh, and actually, I'm also fresh. I tried not to play Counter-Strike and to rest mentally. I had a vacation with my family and spent some time with them, and it was a wonderful time. Everybody is rested, fresh, and charged for the new season. Your next match will be against G2. What are your impressions of their new roster and their game here? What are your expectations from the match? Honestly, it was quite surprising that they removed HooXi. But they showed yesterday that they're indeed ready to play well. It's hard to say anything about the roster, time will show. They're having a honeymoon period, you need to always look in the distance, but we'll see tomorrow when we will play against them. We'll be preparing as usual, nothing special. The last question I want to ask is about your opinion on another roster. Cloud9 completed their team by signing HeavyGod, ICY, and interz. What do you think of this roster? The roster is quite competitive, there's no weak link. interz is a good anchor, and if I'm not mistaken, HeavyGod can play lurk roles well. Those were his roles at a certain point. Everything will depend on how they will develop as a team and play individually, and what will be their mood, let's put it like that. But yeah, they've got a competitive roster. ICY is a good sniper, Ax1Le is a strong player, interz is a good anchor, HeavyGod is a good player, and BoombI4 is a great captain, so everything is in their hands.",20-7-2024 12:02,1721469720000
NiKo stars as G2 outclass Virtus.pro in Riyadh,https://www.hltv.org/news/39429/niko-stars-as-g2-outclass-virtuspro-in-riyadh,"Snax's troops are through to Sunday's grand final after breezing past their opponents. G2 have locked in the first spot in the grand final of the Esports World Cup after hammering Virtus.pro in just under two hours. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač produced a brilliant display of Counter-Strike to inspire G2 to a dominant victory that showcased the potential of this new roster. It will be hard for Virtus.pro to draw lessons from this series. It was one of those matches where everything seemed so effortless, where G2 destroyed their opponents with frictionless ease, won the majority of duels and kept hitting the right timings. ""Everything is clicking this event,"" said NiKo, who posted a 1.89 rating.  ""Everything is going our way. Hopefully, tomorrow everything will go our way. Keeping the hopes up."" Virtus.pro picked up an early lead on Dust2, courtesy of a 1v2 clutch from Petr ""fame"" Bolyshev in the pistol round, but the landscape of the game changed once G2 had money in the bank. A Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov clutch in the first gun round marked the beginning of a dominant 9-0 run, with NiKo and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač leading the charge with a combined 32 frags. The Kovač cousins' show continued in the second half as G2 quickly got within touching distance of victory. Virtus.pro were able to respond in their first gun round after outsmarting their opponents, but there was no stopping G2 in this game. More misery was heaped on Virtus.pro as Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa picked up three quick kills in the pistol round to help G2 turn around a 3v5 situation. It took the Russian team ten rounds to finally get on the board, and though they would win the final three rounds of the half, their comeback hopes were dealt a major blow in the ensuing pistol round after Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski found a trio of kills on the B site. Virtus.pro refused to throw in the towel and took the game to their opponents, but m0NESY eventually put the series to rest with a stunning 1vs3 clutch that highlighted just how much confidence G2's players are oozing now. ""I don't know what is going on, but we're doing very well as a team,"" NiKo said. ""Maybe it is a honeymoon, but we don't really care. We just have to take it map by map, event by event. We will see what happens at BLAST and at Cologne. For now, we want to enjoy this honeymoon.""",20-7-2024 18:57,1721494620000
"KSCERATO: ""This is the best FURIA we've had in a long time""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39425/kscerato-this-is-the-best-furia-weve-had-in-a-long-time,"KSCERATO spoke about the additions of skullz and sidde, and FURIA's run to the quarter-finals at the Esports World Cup. FURIA's debut following the addition of Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros and coach Sid ""sidde"" Macedo ended with a quarter-final finish at the Esports World Cup on Friday. The team had lost their first match with the new lineup to NAVI and went on to traverse the last-chance stage, before they got eliminated after a competitive series against MOUZ. After the elimination loss, Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato spoke to HLTV about the new team, his decision to extend for another three years with the organization he has represented since 2018, listening to other offers, and the Esports World Cup run. You survived the Last Chance stage but ultimately lost to MOUZ in the quarter-finals. How do you feel about your run, considering you recently made changes to the roster? I feel pretty confident about the next one. We've been practicing for two weeks, and it's a pretty new team, so we had to fix some stuff. We have to find a lot of ways to win and close out maps. We need time. Next time we'll be better. What are your thoughts on this series? What I saw on my screen was that, every time, I was dying from someone from behind or something like that. It was crazy but they played really well. We did play well in the first map, I think we just need to close some rounds because we lost some rounds that really ruined our economy. And when your economy is bad, the last rounds of a half are pretty bad. It's hard. The second map was tough. We missed some smokes, we missed some strategy. They played really well. They are pretty good. Torzsi is really confident. I think FalleN did a good job. I think they just missed some individual stuff. The third map was also tough. We got some frags on banana but lost trades on middle or something like that. Or even on banana as well. That's it. I want to ask about your contract renewal with FURIA. Three more years in addition to the six that you have already spent on the team. What does it mean to dedicate such a big part of our career and life to this team? This organization has given me everything. I'm pretty grateful for that. I think now is not the time to leave them. I need to win some tournaments before I leave or something like that. I want to bring a Major to Brazil and I think I have time for that. I have more than ten years left. I'm not going to stop playing this game. There was a lot of talk about where you could possibly go. Did that annoy you or bring any pressure? Not at all. I listened to some offers, but for now I'm staying with FURIA. yuurih has also signed a new contract with FURIA. Did the two of you discuss this matter? I think we have had this thing since the beginning. We're like brothers, you know? We used to play 15 hours straight of CS, more than that. Sometimes even 20 hours, back in Brazil. And I think we have a good relationship. It's like brothers. We didn't discuss it, but if I were to choose another team, I would have discussed it with him. Right around the time your contract extension was announced, skullz joined the team and sidde was promoted to head coach. How do you feel about these changes? skullz is pretty good, and sidde is doing a good job together with FalleN. I feel really good playing this game. I think this is the best FURIA we've had in a long time. I'm pretty confident. I think we need to fix some stuff. As I said, having time is important for us to gain more confidence, gain more experience together, more trades and stuff like that. Next time will be better. We're going to practice now, and I hope we can bring a trophy to Brazil. How has the introduction of skullz affected your roles? Do you feel more free with him taking anchor positions? He always plays as an anchor. He's like a technical guy. He always knows when to smoke, when to rotate and stuff like that. And I feel confident. He also knows how to play with utility. And that gives me a lot of confidence to play aggressively, like on connector on Mirage. What is your opinion about skullz's potential? Do you think he can be a Top 20 player like you? Yeah, I think he can do it. I think he needs time. He's a new guy, and he's playing the best CS he could play. I think he needs time to understand our game style. I think he has a chance. If I'm in the top 20 this year, I'll probably put him as a bold prediction. There was a small but loud crowd, with Neymar among them. What can you say about the support you got on stage? Neymar is like the best, he's an idol for me. He has been through a lot, so his support is important for us. It's a boost for us. I'm already playing with FalleN, who is also an idol of mine, and to see another idol cheering for me is amazing. The crowd support was very nice. I love it. This country is nice. The people are so kind. They know how to talk to you. They treat you like a king. So it's nice. I love it.",20-7-2024 19:22,1721496120000
NAVI rebound from Dust2 flub to beat MOUZ and reach EWC final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39430/navi-rebound-from-dust2-flub-to-beat-mouz-and-reach-ewc-final,"A disastrous Dust2 did not impede NAVI from booking a series versus G2. The second semi-final of the Esports World Cup has concluded, seeing Natus Vincere send MOUZ packing after recovering from a dreadful showing in the first map of the series. Natus Vincere are looking to pick up where they left off before the player break, securing their second-consecutive grand final after finishing the BLAST Premier Spring Final as the runner-ups to Spirit in their last outing. Natus Vincere are now slated to square off against the new-look G2 in the grand final in Riyadh. It will be the first meeting between the two teams since their semi-final face-off at PGL Major Copenhagen. One could have been forgiven for mistaking Natus Vincere's map pick of Dust2 as the choice of MOUZ, as the latter side looked impeccable on the defense to kick off the series. With the individuals of MOUZ firing on all cylinders, Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's men managed to scrape together just a single round from their opponent's smothering defense, allowing Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and co. to close things out with a quick 13-1 scoreline. MOUZ's pick of Nuke proved to be a far more competitive affair, as the two sides were neck-and-neck throughout the first half, with warmed-up pair Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov and Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy leading the charge for Natus Vincere. A pistol-round win on the offense lit a spark for a six-round streak for Natus Vincere, allowing them to steal away their opponent's pick after quelling a brief attempt by MOUZ at a comeback. Natus Vincere maintained their winning ways on Mirage, charging ahead on the defense as w0nderful continued to display brilliant individual form. Although Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo was able to get his team on the board with an impressive 1v3 clutch, it was not enough to halt Natus Vincere from taking a commanding 9-3 lead. A pistol-round win for MOUZ gave siuhy's troops a glimmer of hope in the second half, but Natus Vincere immediately retorted with an eco-round victory, allowing them to close out the map in short order with a 13-5 scoreline.",20-7-2024 22:52,1721508720000
Live updates from Esports World Cup semi-finals,https://www.hltv.org/news/39428/live-updates-from-esports-world-cup-semi-finals,"Speaking to Freya ""Freya"" Spiers shortly after his team's elimination from the Esports World Cup, young rifler Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo shared his thoughts on the match versus Natus Vincere and MOUZ's impending preparations for IEM Cologne. On losing Nuke: ""When we went to the CT-side we lost ourselves because we started tilting a bit for stupid mistakes. It got harder and harder to come back because people were mentally, maybe a bit off."" On NAVI's individuals: ""I just have to say that I think they were very sharp individually. w0nderful was really insane, and also jL, b1t, they were doing their thing on the server. It also made the game really hard for us, even on Dust2 where we were better."" On Cologne preparation: ""We will have a little bit of rest after this tournament, and then we will head into bootcamp, where we will have some good practice. I think from the bootcamp we go straight from Cologne, so we just want to have a hot start in Cologne."" MOUZ 5-13  Natus Vincere After enduring a difficult 1-13 scoreline on their own map pick of Dust2, Natus Vincere managed to piece together wins on Nuke and Mirage to send MOUZ packing from the Esports World Cup, earning them a place in the final versus the new-look G2. Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov was no doubt the player to watch in this series, as the young Ukrainian AWPer had crucial impact on the two maps that his team won. MOUZ 4-10  Natus Vincere MOUZ 3-9  Natus Vincere MOUZ 1-5  Natus Vincere MOUZ 1-4  Natus Vincere MOUZ 0-1  Natus Vincere MOUZ 8-13  Natus Vincere After a truly devastating start to the series, Natus Vincere have bounced back with a 13-8 win on their opponent's pick of Nuke. With Ukrainian duo Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov and Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy hitting their stride on Nuke, Natus Vincere will now be looking to close things out against MOUZ with a win on the deciding map of Mirage. MOUZ 6-10  Natus Vincere A second pistol-round victory has kickstarted a streak of four rounds for Natus Vincere on the offense, giving the international side some breathing room after previously allowing MOUZ to tie things up at half-time. MOUZ 6-6  Natus Vincere MOUZ 4-5  Natus Vincere After a bit of a back-and-forth affair to kick off the start of their opponent's map pick, Natus Vincere have managed to eke out a lead on the CT-side of Nuke. The international side look far livelier than on their own pick of Dust2, where Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's men managed to garner just a single round amidst a pummelling from MOUZ. MOUZ 2-2  Natus Vincere MOUZ 13-1  Natus Vincere MOUZ have kicked off their semi-final series versus Natus Vincere in style, bagging their opponent's pick with a dominant 13-1 scoreline, hardly breaking a sweat as they now prepare to play their pick of Nuke. Natus Vincere's individuals will have to find their footing if they want to drag this series to Mirage, with captain Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen in particular having issues throughout the first map, only bagging his first kills in the final round of play. MOUZ 9-1  Natus Vincere It's looking like we may end up with another stomp of a semi-final at EWC, as MOUZ have allowed just one round to slip from their grasp so far on their opponent's map pick, giving them a staggering eight-round lead as the end of the half approaches. Four rounds now separate Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek's men from marching into their pick of Nuke with a map victory already under their belt. MOUZ 4-0  Natus Vincere Natus Vincere's map pick of Dust2 is setting the stage for the Esport World Cup's second semi-final, with MOUZ's selection of Nuke acting as the second map. If needed, Mirage is set to serve as the deciding map of the series. In an interview with Mike ""DarfMike"" Winnick, G2's Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski discussed their unlikely reunion on the international side, over six years since last playing together on Virtus.pro. On bad blood between the two: TaZ: ""Keeping it short, yeah. But hey, you know what they say about time, it heals wounds. I just believe that in life if you hold grudges you will not be able to succeed in the present."" Snax: ""I would say after the time I almost forgot every bad moment. Obviously, there were some, but also we had a lot of good moments. As a team, it was a really good time in my life."" On adding Snax: TaZ: ""I knew what I could expect from him, definitely on CT-side. I know he's the type of guy who can play AWP, rifle, MAG-7; he doesn't care what he has, he will always try to find a good timing or space on site."" On impact of Dallas win: TaZ: ""Definitely winning Dallas with a stand-in put a lot of pressure on the organization, not even outside but from inside it. I just felt that this team was on fumes, and we just needed to reinvent ourselves."" On the team's impressive form: Everything is clicking this event. Everything is going our way. Hopefully, tomorrow everything will go our way. Keeping the hopes up. On whether he expected the team to be this good so quickly: Honestly, I had a very good feeling going up against Spirit. I knew we had a very good chance of winning. I even told the guys we were going to 2-0 them. I don't know what is going on, but we're doing very well as a team. Maybe it is a honeymoon, but we don't really care. We just have to take it map by map, event by event. We will see what happens at BLAST and at Cologne. For now, we want to enjoy this honeymoon. On being back to his best level: It feels great. It's been a while since I played this well. I don't think I had played this well in CS2. It feels good to come back to my form. I don't want to jinx it, but I felt very good at the start of the season, at the bootcamp. Hopefully, I can keep up this form. On whether m0NESY is the best in the world: For me, he definitely is. He has everything he needs. He just seems way more versatile than donk, for example. For me, he's definitely the best player in the world. G2 have booked a spot in Sunday's grand final in Riyadh thanks to a convincing 2-0 victory over Virtus.pro. Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov closed the series with a stylish 1v3 clutch, but it was Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač who did most of the work for G2, posting a jaw-dropping 1.89 series rating. Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski's troops will now await the result of the other semifinal, between Natus Vincere and MOUZ. G2 9-3  Virtus.pro Just like on Dust2, the first half ends with the two teams separated by six rounds. Virtus.pro have a mountain to climb to turn this one around on the T side. Can they at least make it a tougher contest? G2 9-0  Virtus.pro Nothing seems to be going Virtus.pro's way on Ancient, either. It's one of those days... NiKo's highest ratings: 2.70 vs  ORDER2.49 vs  Virtus.pro2.41 vs  Luminosity2.40 vs  noKappa2.40 vs  BIG What a dominant performance from G2. They completed destroyed Virtus.pro on their own map pick to take the lead in this series, with Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač combining for a whopping 47 frags in this game. Next up is Ancient, where Virtus.pro have only a 38% winrate in the last three months. G2 9-3  Virtus.pro How quickly this game has turned. G2 were in control from the moment they had money to work with, winning nine rounds in a row to take a commanding lead. Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov ended the half in style, with a knife kill onto David ""n0rb3r7"" Danielyan, but the Kovač cousins are the ones leading the charge with a combined 32 frags. Virtus.pro survived a couple of scary Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač Deagle attempts, but the first gunround goes the other way as Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov takes advantage of the clock running down: A fiery pistol starts off Dust2 and it goes the way of Virtus.pro after Petr ""fame"" Bolyshev salvaged the nearly thrown 4v2 situation with a clutch: ""We have looked for different options, but I think Snax was probably the most realistic one and also one of the few that were possible to get,"" Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač said to Freya ""Freya"" Spiers on the topic of his new in-game leader before going on to contrast him and Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen: ""Snax is very calm and positive, and I don't wanna say anything bad about our previous IGL, but it is a huge contrast for us."" ""He has impressed me with the way he approaches the team. I think the reason people were criticizing him for his time in GamerLegion, the way he wants to call is that you need to have the types of players we have now on the team, and I think that's the reason why it didn't work out in GL. I don't think they had enough of those pieces to make his system work. We should be able to fit in his system just right."" ""Honestly, it was quite surprising that they removed HooXi. But they showed yesterday that they're indeed ready to play well,"" Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov said in an interview with HLTV. ""It's hard to say anything about the roster, time will show. They're having a honeymoon period, you need to always look in the distance, but we'll see tomorrow when we will play against them. We'll be preparing as usual, nothing special."" Check out the full interview, in which electroNic also spoke about VP's playstyle changes and finally starting to get the balance right after a busy end of the last season: After a long run of events which made it hard for Virtus.pro to get up to speed with Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov, the break seems to have done the team well. That counts double for David ""n0rb3r7"" Danielyan, who had his best series in some time against Vitality yesterday, ending his string of poor form. G2 didn't even need the best version of Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov to beat Spirit, and that's in no small part thanks to Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, who has led the way for the new squad. MOUZ avoided their dreaded FaZe matchup after beating FURIA, as Natus Vincere took care of Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's team for them. It still looks like a toss-up for Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and company as far as betting odds go, and it's no wonder: NAVI's improvement at the Spring Final combined with the fact that these two teams have yet to meet with their current lineups makes it a hard one to call. The top two teams in the world fell on the bottom side of the bracket over the past two days, as the new G2, recently bolstered by the controversial additions of Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski, took down Spirit, and Virtus.pro eliminated Vitality. The two winners are now set to clash in today's first semi-final in just two hours' time:",20-7-2024 23:00,1721509200000
"TaZ: ""It's really hard to play against us; I don't think we have a weakness in the team""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39431/taz-its-really-hard-to-play-against-us-i-dont-think-we-have-a-weakness-in-the-team,"The Polish coach said he is not surprised to see such a dominant G2 right out of the gate. G2 moved comfortably into the final of the Esports World Cup with a quick 2-0 victory against Virtus.pro, outperforming the Russian team in every department behind a spirited performance from Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač. It's still early days, but G2 seem to be heading in the right direction, and they will have on Sunday the opportunity to win their second title in 2024 against Natus Vincere. After the victory over Virtus.pro, Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas sat down with HLTV to discuss the team's impressive form in Riyadh and the additions of Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa during the off-season. Are you surprised you've managed to come this far in your first event with the new roster? I'm not surprised. I'm happy that we are making progress and playing very well. Was the team really feeling it today, or do you think it was not a great day for VP? I think it's really hard to play against us because I don't think that we have a weakness in the team. So, it's also probably a very hard task to create a game plan, like, 'Where do we want to attack? Do we want to go against Sneaky Beaky Snax and huNter-? Do we want to go and maybe duo NiKo and Mario malbsMd?' And then, on one of these spots, a wild Ilya m0NESY will appear. During the break, you got malbsMd and Snax. Can you share the role you played in that decision, with peca being the General Manager? We were talking, so it was both a management decision and my idea. I'm just happy I have that trust from the management. And I think they deserve some slack for going through with getting these players. Many were surprised to see Snax joining the team. Was it your decision? Did you consider other options? It's always hard to make a lineup change. It never came easy to me during my over twenty-year career. But when we were talking inside the team, when we were talking with the management, it was clear that we needed to make a change, and I just came up with the idea that I knew what Snax could do individually. The only questions were how good he was as an IGL and how we would mesh together again, right? I'm just happy with how it is working, and we will do our best to keep going and to keep the mood up. There was a lot of talk about role clashes. How are you handling that? Is it hard to figure out? I don't think it's hard to figure out. I did some interview about it. It's about talking with the players, with the team, looking at the pieces you have and meshing them together. In the current Counter-Strike meta, everyone wants to be a star, right? First of all, you need to find the right mentality of a player to actually build a team. And if you have the right mentality, there is no such thing as making sacrifices. If you talk about sacrifices, what is b1t playing in NAVI? What is Jimpphat doing in MOUZ? What is ropz doing in FaZe? I think that Mario wouldn't mind being mentioned around these guys. You’re reuniting with Snax. You have a history of playing with each other and you’re both Polish. Does it help in your game-planning process? Yes, it definitely helps. Because we trust each other, we know that we can help each other inside and outside of the game. So I think it helps a lot. There was some bad blood between you and Snax. Can you set the record straight: what was your relationship with Snax like when he joined the team? Obviously, after VP there was some disconnect between us, but I believe that you cannot stay in the past and you need to move forward to achieve success. We weren't, like, super good. We were okay. Sometimes we spoke at events, but it wasn't like, 'Hey, I have a friend. Let's call him.' No, no, no, no. It wasn't like that. It was definitely about what he could do on the server. I'm just happy we got him. Tomorrow you'll face either NAVI or MOUZ. Who would you like to face and why? I would really love to play NAVI because they beat us at the Major and they were constantly beating us in the past, so I would really like to get revenge. But I wouldn't mind to face MOUZ. They also beat us lately, if I remember correctly. Actually, no, we beat them. So yeah, MOUZ, we are good.",21-7-2024 00:00,1721512800000
"w0nderful on facing m0NESY: ""I never think about it because I play against a team, not one player""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39432/w0nderful-on-facing-m0nesy-i-never-think-about-it-because-i-play-against-a-team-not-one-player,"w0nderful expects a 50-50 game against G2 and describes them as a great team. After surprising everyone with a victory at PGL Major Copenhagen, Natus Vincere were hit with the post-Major blues and suffered early exits at ESL Pro League S19 and IEM Dallas. They returned to form at the BLAST Premier Spring Final 2024 and reached the final, but the jury was still out on the actual level of the team led by Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen. Upon returning from the player break Natus Vincere made their second consecutive grand final at the Esports World Cup, quashing critics as they set to face off against the new G2 for the trophy. Ahead of the final clash, Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov sat down with HLTV to discuss their earlier win against MOUZ, Natus Vincere's form, and the upcoming final. You beat MOUZ and made it to the Esports World Cup grand final, but the first map didn't go well and you lost 1-13. How did it happen? I don't know, we prepared for that map and played it often in practice. We didn't wake up and do what we were supposed to, so we lost. There were some key moments that we should have won, but we didn't, so that's how the map ended. Then you managed to win Nuke, MOUZ's pick. You had a strong T-side despite a tied first half. Can you tell me how you collected yourselves and pushed it to map three? We've played Nuke a lot this tournament, and we knew what they were going to do. We didn't have any second thoughts, we were just playing. We forgot the first map, played our game, and came back. I think they loosened up a bit after the first map, so we just did our things on the T-side, and that's it. Map three went pretty heavily in your favor. Did you expect a tighter fight before the map started? I never expect it to be easy or tough, I just want to play the game. So… we just played. I certainly was focused on playing, not thinking about anything, and then when we had a big lead, I realized we could win this easily. You were clearly the crowd favorites tonight. What are your impressions of the support here and the event in general? It's nice when people support you and the crowd screams for you, especially when you start winning rounds. It's always nice to feel support, it's great. Before the break, B1ad3 said there would be changes if you continued to play as you played at the end of last season. Do you feel confident in the roster now? I think so, we made two finals in a row. In the first, we lost to Spirit, in the second one we will play against G2, and we will see what happens. I think we are in good shape. We had a dip in form for two tournaments after the Major, but we restored our clear thoughts and are now capable of showing a great game. You will play against G2 tomorrow. What are your thoughts on their new roster? Their new roster is definitely better than the last one. They play very well, and it's their first tournament, so that might be a honeymoon. I don't know how they will do in the future, but it's a great roster and a tough opponent. What are your expectations from tomorrow's game? Do you feel you're the favorites to an extent, or is it a tossup? I don't think about it or feel anything, it will be a 50-50 game. The better-prepared and stronger team will win. Regarding the upcoming sniper duel, what do you think of playing against m0NESY? In your view, are you facing the best player in the world? Yes, he is showing a good game, I would even say great. He is 100% the number one player in the world right now. We've faced them many times, but I've never thought about the sniper duel. I never think about it because I play against a team, not one player. Let's see what will happen tomorrow. TaZ told me that he would love to take revenge for the Major. Are you ready to show the winning form from the Major? Of course we are!",21-7-2024 14:17,1721564220000

Live updates from Esports World Cup grand final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39433/live-updates-from-esports-world-cup-grand-final,"On the final: ""NAVI were clearly the better team today, it's amazing how they bounced back yesterday and today after going 1-0 down. We gave them too much space, too much respect in some rounds, and they were good at abusing all the space we gave them. ""We are just not ready to beat them. Something is just not clicking against NAVI."" That now makes it seven wins in a row for Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen against former side G2. It was convincing on Nuke, and it was annihilation here. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy's T side play should be remembered in particular as Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen called Apps play after Apps play to expose the holes in the new G2's game. This is NAVI's second trophy of 2024, matching Spirit, and going some way to counter the fluke shouts from Copenhagen. G2 3-11  Natus Vincere This man just loves Inferno deciders, doesn't he? Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy gave FaZe nightmares and he's knocking on G2's door now. G2 2-8  Natus Vincere Apps pop number four from Natus Vincere but this team Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa stands tall. More than tall, he was a giant here: A good 450 damage dealt from one clip in his AK-47. G2 1-7  Natus Vincere It's a commanding lead now. G2 tried to adapt in Apps with Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov posted up, but Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy just swings and rips his (and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa's) heads off. G2 1-5  Natus Vincere Another strong T start for NAVI, with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa targeted by two Apps pops in key swing rounds. Both times, Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's call paid off. G2 1-1  Natus Vincere A timely Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač push down Banana catches the right timing and he bodyshots down two as NAVI's pistol round advantage is wiped out. The difference a natural anchor makes: Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy had 17 kills and 88 ADR playing Ramp on CT and Lobby on T. His opposite number, Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, had 8 kills and 40 ADR in those positions. G2 have enjoyed their honeymoon so far but as time goes on their role clashes still could plague this roster. G2 6-13  Natus Vincere Nothing to report there, as G2 fall flat on their face trying to assemble any semblance of a T side on Nuke. Inferno well decide the EWC 2024. The last time NAVI played it? PGL Major Copenhagen's grand final against FaZe. G2 6-9  Natus Vincere Pistol and anti-force converted for NAVI on their map pick. No excuses now. G2 5-6  Natus Vincere ""No easy rounds for G2,"" says Chad ""SPUNJ"" Burchill on commentary as Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov wipes some sweat off his brow. It's Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač who has come up big with two key multi-frags to stunt Natus Vincere who, as per usual, were running a tight ship on their methodical T side. G2 1-4  Natus Vincere More big impact from Counter-Strike's chief moments player Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov as G2 win on the low buy. Big round. G2 0-2  Natus Vincere Clinical pistol for NAVI despite Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov's opener. Lots of CS left to play. MVP favorite Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač may have top fragged but there were a lot of empty calories in his showing. 7 eco kills in the first half, and a 4K in the second pistol when the round was already lost means it all still to play for if you're Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov, Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy, or Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov. Despite some tough times on the A site Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa still proves himself in the biggest match of his career. The Deagle round at the end of the first half, and a triple entry up B to close the game itself. He is one hell of a talent, no matter the roles. G2 16-14  Natus Vincere It's a B rush call from Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski and a triple kill from new man and x-factor Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa that secure map one for G2. Important one to win after NAVI had them under the cosh with a great T side. The Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov clutch will be what is remembered but this could have easily gone the other way. G2 15-13  Natus Vincere That's how you get people to forget about a few overpeeks. He's been quiet all game, made some bad decisions, but none of it matters when rounds can turn this quickly. 30 seconds, 1v3, mollied out on Ramp, and he still finds a way. G2 12-12  Natus Vincere A tad over-ambitious from a frustrated Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov, and his overpeek gives Natus Vincere a 2v2 post-plant that is easy to convert for overtime. But it did get close! Just look at this Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač smoke defuse attempt. G2 11-11  Natus Vincere Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov has arrived with a double AWP kill close-range on A, with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa grabbing another two to get us to 11-11. This is the duo Natus Vincere will be most scared of coming online. G2 9-9  Natus Vincere G2's mighty individuals have come unstuck on CT, with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa targeted on A and even Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov (who is 10-15) struggling to halt the well-oiled NAVI machine. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy have done their homework. G2 8-6  Natus Vincere The B rush gets the plant and a pick for NAVI, enough to win the pistol and draw the gap to two rounds. G2 8-4  Natus Vincere An awkward — and prolonged — fight in Middle eventually went Mihai ""iM"" Ivan's way over Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov with the help of a nice flash from B to kick off an eco win for NAVI. That's twice now G2 have collapsed on the A site, and their bank was low already after how close the rounds have been. No issue, though, as Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and his signature Deagle keep G2 in control at the switch. G2 6-1  Natus Vincere G2 have continued to extend their lead, but could this be the turning point? Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski all but secured the round with a double entry on the B fake, but the bomb was already committed to A and Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius flipped the round on its head. G2 3-0  Natus Vincere G2 0-0  Natus Vincere Ancient to start, the playground of Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa. Can he be shut down in Middle? On making the final: ""This is the first big one, second LAN, it's an amazing feeling. Coming from Guatemala, it is an amazing experience. Having next to me, NiKo, huNter-, it feels great."" On his comfort in his role: ""6-7 out of 10. On T side I'm destroying everyone, on CT I'm just there."" Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov have led their teams' efforts so far, with strong performances in all six of their map wins. The Bosnian is hunting his 9th MVP, while it would be w0nderful's first ever. On 6-0 vs G2: ""In the seventh time it's going to be different, new positions, new captain. It's a thing you try not to think about it but the community think about it a lot, yeah it's funny."" On TaZ's 'no weaknesses' comment: ""They have this floor and ceiling in the team when you have a fresh team, when everything is going according to plan. They are yet to struggle, it feels like they have no gaps. But once the opponents have more data there might be. I hope we did our homework."" On NAVI's form: ""We are kinda in the same form as the Major, but we really peaked in the finals of the Major, going off that Mirage loss, we ended up playing an amazing Inferno. In this tournament, and London, we reached the grand final. I hope we go out all guns blazing."" Natus Vincere are in a purple patch of form of their own and can't be counted out, particularly amidst a resurgent level from Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy and a Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov who is showing less fear of taking over games by himself. The team around Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen failed to beat Spirit to the trophy at BLAST Spring Final before the break, but have made consecutive grand finals with a run that saw them take down FaZe and MOUZ en route to the title decider. A huge factor going in NAVI's favor is Aleksib's unblemished record vs. his former organization. He has won all six of his matches over G2 since joining Natus Vincere (five best-of-threes, one best-of-one), but G2's changes and a honeymoon start with their roster could be too much to overcome here. All eyes were on G2 coming into Esports World Cup, and it's been hard to wrench gazes away. Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov was in transcendent form throughout the first half of the year and debates raged on about whether he or Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets is the best player in the world. But G2 struggled. Despite consistently making playoffs, the team repeatedly fell short of trophies, and the writing seemed to be on the wall for changes as the season's end drew near. A title at IEM Dallas without Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen all but sealed that fate, and the team made significant changes by bringing in Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa during the break. The Guatemalan rifler turned heads with his exceptional level on M80, but his addition to G2 raised questions and criticism about brutal role clashes within the team and the decision to make him play anchor roles. G2 have silenced that critique, at least for now, by dominating upon their debut in Riyadh. Wins over The MongolZ, Spirit, and Virtus.pro put them through to the final, and the scariest part is how it has barely been on m0NESY to lead that charge. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač is having his best Big Event in almost three years, and his best by far in CS2, while malbsMd is faring well in anchor positions and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač has turned a dismal run of form around. Can NAVI really put a stop to this? It's championship Sunday in Riyadh, and we're in for a treat with Natus Vincere and G2 duking it out in a best-of-three for a $400,000 grand prize. Both organizations are chasing their second trophy of the year after their first wins came unexpectedly during the Spring season. Natus Vincere lifted the silverware at PGL Major Copenhagen in what some pundits and fans have referred to as a fluke run, while G2 pulled off a miracle at IEM Dallas with Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip as a stand-in for their now-former in-game leader Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen. Spirit are the only team with two trophies in 2024, but they will soon have company from one of these two sides.",21-7-2024 23:45,1721598300000
NAVI fire past G2 to win Esports World Cup,https://www.hltv.org/news/39436/navi-fire-past-g2-to-win-esports-world-cup,"A Copenhagen Major final-resplendent level from b1t on Inferno powered NAVI to a reverse-sweep victory. Natus Vincere are the victors of Esports World Cup 2024 after fending off G2 in the grand final, recovering from an overtime defeat on Ancient (14-16) with a convincing win on Nuke (13-6) and complete annihilation on Inferno (13-6). The victory extends Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's flawless record against his former organization to 7-0, and grabs his team their second trophy of the year after their surprise run to the title at PGL Major Copenhagen. Talks of whether that Major victory was a fluke raged on over the months that followed, and Natus Vincere took a step in countering that argument with a runners-up finish to Spirit at BLAST Spring Final before the tournament break. They now take a massive stride forward with a second trophy lift, and a convincing one at that after they shut down a red-hot start from G2. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač was in excellent form coming into the final, but he wasn't given much of a chance to extend his dominance. He mustered a few lower-impact multi-kills on Ancient and put in decent efforts on Nuke and Inferno, but Natus Vincere did well to avoid him on the latter two maps and his fragging wasn't enough to make up for an uncharacteristically quiet Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov. The Russian sniper had a few highlight moments, but his repeated overextensions, unforced errors, and some crucial misses left a gaping hole in G2's game that NAVI wasted no time in exploiting. G2 were also marred by a dismal performance from Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, who had a return to form during his team's EWC run but came unstuck in the final with a 0.67 rating across the series. That was in stark contrast to Natus Vincere, whose teamplay and combined prowess completely outclassed G2 on the latter two maps of the series. G2 chose Ancient to kick off the series, a map where NiKo has looked more and more comfortable and now has Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa's exceptional prowess in Middle to count upon as backup. The Bosnian rifler's kill count by the end of the map is rather misleading, however, as a significant portion of his output came against ecos or in already lost rounds. He still provided a handful of multi-kills and a few impact rounds, but malbsMd's openers and kills from the backlines from Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski was what helped power G2 to a dominant 6-0 start. Entries into A gave NAVI a window back into the map, and they closed the gap to four rounds at the half before capitalizing on a quiet map and a handful of overextensions from m0NESY to take the lead, 11-10. But as m0NESY giveth, m0NESY taketh away: the Russian sniper got a double to tie the game, and despite another overextension in round 24 that allowed the game to go to overtime, he came up massive with a 1vs3 clutch to set his team on map point before malbsMd cut straight through the B defenses to close out the map. Natus Vincere came out of the gates swinging on their Nuke pick, though, repeatedly exploiting malbsMd at Ramp and influencing rotations to perfection to crack into sites for a 4-0 start. A triple kill from m0NESY's Scout kicked off a recovery effort for G2 to prevent a runaway, with NiKo leading the way to tie the game at the half. However, the effort was all for naught as G2 failed to muster any semblance of an offense after the side swap, winning no T rounds in what ended as a blowout victory for Natus Vincere, 13-6. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy had started to heat up on Nuke, showing what a natural Ramp anchor can do compared to G2's labored effort, and he kicked it up a gear on Inferno. The Ukrainian rifler looked like he was entering a flow-state equal to his Inferno showing in the Major grand final with the way he dismantled G2's defenses, with an early game plan to exploit Apartments paying off for Natus Vincere. It wasn't until the fourth Apartments pop that G2 finally managed to halt the attack, and it was only thanks to an incredible quad kill from malbsMd. The round did little to alleviate the pain caused by b1t, though, and Natus Vincere were quick to bring the annihilation of G2 to a close. Three ham-fisted rounds were all that NiKo's side managed before their fate in Ryadh was sealed by a complete shutdown of a B attack by Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan to claim victory.",22-7-2024 00:00,1721599200000
"Snax: ""I shut down a little bit on Inferno""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39438/snax-i-shut-down-a-little-bit-on-inferno,"Whilst Snax is pleased with G2's run to the Esports World Cup final, he feels that with more practice, there is more to come from his new team. G2 hit the reset button in the off-season and ditched their most maligned players, Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen and Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković, in an effort to find a consistent formula for winning titles. Whilst there was some excitement regarding the arrival of Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski, there was also plenty of scepticism. The clash of roles created by the incorporation of malbsMd seemed difficult to solve on paper, and questions were asked of Snax's credentials as a top-tier IGL. A run to the grand final of Esports World Cup was the unexpected answer G2 had for their critics, and whilst they were beaten to the trophy by Natus Vincere, the excellent levelled displayed by G2 throughout their run in Riyadh was a tantalizing taste of the potential of their firepower-laden new roster. Following their defeat at the hands of Natus Vincere, G2's new leader Snax sat down with HLTV to give his thoughts on his team's campaign, the pressure of taking up the reins at G2, and his goals for the upcoming season. It's your first event with the team and an incredible result, a grand final. Overall, what are your impressions from this run? Are you more upset with the misfortune in the grand final, or happy with the result? To be honest I would say both. I'm happy and also sad, it's not nice to lose in the final. I can say that I have really good impressions about the team, how we are playing, what players I have and how they understand the game. I wasn't counting on a final. I thought that we could show some good CS, but game by game when we started to win, and in a good way, we started to believe even more and maybe even put ourselves as favorites. Maybe that was a small problem. We didn't have that much time for preparation, I didn't fully play on Inferno that much, for a couple of years even, so it wasn't that easy for me. But I would say from now on, if we will have a little bit more time, I can put everything that I want on the server and just have more tools, because we played each map four or five times before the tournament, mostly four, so obviously it wasn't big preparation. I felt a little bit of stress came in the final moments. Overall I could say I'm happy. Can you talk a little on Inferno? It was not convincing play from you there, what do you think was the primary reason for that? Was it stress as you said? Maybe not stress, we didn't play it that much. Like you could see on Ancient, we played it several times this tournament so it was already twice more than we practiced on server before the tournament. So lack of practice I would say, it was hard. I also maybe shut down a little bit myself after some point on Inferno, losing the third round, the eco on A, also didn't help. Like I said I didn't play Inferno that much, and with that I would just like to end this topic. You came into G2 with malbsMd, a very interesting up-and-coming talent. What is your impression of him? He's a really nice guy. He's funny and likes to laugh, I feel like he's a really good guy, he's listening, he's young, he has this hunger to play and work with the team. I really like him, and yeah he's a good player and aimer. In terms of you being an IGL, the best team you led before was GamerLegion, and it was for under a year. Is there any pressure in that regard, now that you got to a tier-one title-contending team? I mean I've been there a couple years ago, I was even there sometimes back in the days in VP, maybe not as much as TaZ and NEO, but for sure for eight or nine months I was calling in the team. So yeah, I don't fully feel the pressure, I just feel like I didn't have enough time to put everything on paper that I want, and also you can imagine before the tournament I was saying ""guys, there is not that much time to focus on everything we can do."" On some of the maps I feel better, some of the maps I'm just lacking all the tools. As for pressure, nah I don't think so. I know I have good guys on the team, good aimers, good players, they are considered some of the best in the world. So I think if we keep working hard and just focus on practice, training, everything, it's going to be even easier for me to call. We just need to keep understanding each other. I hope it's going to be the first final of many to come. In terms of your performance on the server, HooXi was famously one of the least-fragging IGLs on the scene. Was it one of your main goals to improve the team in that regard, or was it something else that you prioritized? No, I would say as an IGL I prioritized more the tools, the strats, everything we can have on the server. Both CT and T side, it's not like I am only focusing on T side, but for this tournament I did. Like I say, there was not much time to fix everything. I would say I could even get 0-24 every match, but if we are going to win the final, I am okay with that if it's going to help. I could even deal with the devil to have some kind of pact like this (laughs). Now I feel like my shooting is not that bad, I can obviously hit some. I'm not comparing myself to anyone, I don't want to hear or say that I'm the best IGL, best shooter or whatever, that's not my goal. My goal is to win tournaments the best way that we can, by calls, by everything. Many were surprised to see you joining G2. Was it a surprise to you to receive this offer? I mean it depends. A little bit, yes, because we had talks before then I didn't join. I would say I was surprised, and I'm also happy that they invited me to the team. You said in an interview previously that there were some talks with G2 in 2022. Can you talk more about that? I think I said everything about this topic. You have a history of playing with TaZ, what are your impressions from reuniting with him? I think it's pretty nice. We are together now as grown men, we talk normally, we have a good history as well. I think he surprised me as a coach, the things he brings to the server and outside of the server are pretty good, I really like working with him right now and it was a pleasure at this tournament. It didn't go the way we wanted, but it's good, I like it. Speaking of the season, there is a lot upcoming. What is your main goal for this season? My main goal is to show everything on the server that I have as an IGL, good strats and calls. Be in as many finals as we can, win as many as we can, obviously this is always the point in my career, I want to win everything no matter what. I will try my best and focus hard on winning. I don't want to end in another situation like this tournament, I could put Nuke on myself, I could put Inferno a bit on myself. I wasn't as decisive as I was before on other maps, but I think it's a process that we need to go through. I think we have really nice potential right now with the players that we have, we just need to play a little bit more together. So my goal is to lead those guys. It would be really nice to win a Major again with TaZ, but also with NiKo and all the other guys. So yeah, that would be my goal, to win.",22-7-2024 14:30,1721651400000
b1t wins career-first MVP at Esports World Cup,https://www.hltv.org/news/39435/b1t-wins-career-first-mvp-at-esports-world-cup,"NAVI's Ukrainian star completed a late charge at the MVP with a 1.74 rating on the grand final's decider. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy is the HLTV Most Valuable Player (MVP) of Esports World Cup 2024 after dominating map two and three of the grand final against G2. The Ukrainian sharpshooter was a distant third in the MVP race before the final, but took advantage of quiet title deciders from Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov to clinch the individual accolade at the last gasp. In Natus Vincere's map wins, b1t averaged a 1.48 rating including peaks of 1.96 against FURIA, 1.54 against MOUZ, and 1.45 and 1.74 against G2 in the final. Even when discounting the first round, where b1t destroyed the lower-ranked FURIA, he had a higher rating in his team's playoff map wins (1.41) than w0nderful (1.39) and NiKo (1.39). Natus Vincere's stats in all map wins NiKo came closest in the end, having ended seven of his ten maps above a 1.25 rating, but the Bosnian did drop off in the all-important last BO3 (and even inflated his grand final numbers in round losses and anti-ecos on Ancient). Match that with b1t's dominance of Appartments on Inferno and Lobby on Nuke in the Grand Final, and you have the recipe for an MVP. It is b1t's career-first MVP after coming close a few times behind Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev in NAVI's dominant run of late 2021, and cements him as the now-international side's franchise player in s1mple's continued absence. It was also not the first grand final decider he took over this year, having put FaZe to the sword in a similar fashion at PGL Major Copenhagen with a 2.16 rating on the same map of Inferno. Find all HLTV MVP winners on our dedicated MVP page. But this time he had the form beforehand to keep himself in the MVP conversation and took full advantage of others falling behind in the race. That meant that, in his seventh Big Event triumph, it was finally b1t's turn to shine as the best player of the tournament, something made even more impressive given his tricky anchor roles on CT side.",22-7-2024 00:15,1721600100000

Here are 10 clips from the one-sided battle between the former teammates. Heading into championship Sunday at the Esports World Cup, Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy was trailing by quite some distance behind Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač in the HLTV MVP race. But while his main rivals slowed down in the title decider, b1t turned it up a notch with a 1.45 and 1.74 rating in Natus Vincere's wins on Nuke and Inferno to snatch the award away and claim his career-first HLTV medal. Everything seemed to be going his way, and that counted double whenever he was up against Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov. The Ukrainian kept running circles around his former NAVI Junior teammate and off-the-server friend, going 14-3 in duels against him in the two map wins that earned Natus Vincere their second title this year. Always looking to make a difference, m0NESY is not one to stay in one place for too long, but that kept working against the flashy AWPer this time around as he was clearly off the mark. He was growing increasingly frustrated and impatient as b1t put his pinpoint aim on display and, on occasion, found just the right timings to ruin m0NESY's day.

NAVI claim No. 1 in world rankings after EWC win,https://www.hltv.org/news/39441/navi-claim-no-1-in-world-rankings-after-ewc-win,"The Ukrainian organization returns to the top of the pile for the first time since August 2022. Natus Vincere have risen to number one in the HLTV World Rankings following their title-winning campaign at the Esports World Cup. The team led by Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen previously peaked at No. 2 after their surprising Major victory in Copenhagen before dropping down the rankings, as they couldn't keep up their form and suffered early exits at ESL Pro League S19 and IEM Dallas. They returned to form at the BLAST Premier Spring Final, where they reached the final, but the late resurgence couldn't prevent their drop to fifth in the rankings ahead of the summer break. Upon Natus Vincere's return to competition at the Esports World Cup, however, Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy's troops found form once again. They won the tournament by defeating FaZe, MOUZ, and G2 to lift the title and propel themselves to the top spot in HLTV's and ESL's world rankings. NAVI's rise also marks the first time that an Aleksib-led team reached the No. 1 spot in the world rankings. The Finnish tactician previously came closest with ENCE (No. 2) and G2 (No. 3). Natus Vincere replace Spirit as the highest-ranked team in the world after Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets and company reached the milestone for the first time in the organization's history just over a month ago. Spirit also got leapfrogged by MOUZ, while G2's grand final appearance returns them to the top five at the expense of FaZe, who drop out for the first time since the conclusion of IEM Sydney in October.

blameF stars en route to first event win in fnatic,https://www.hltv.org/news/39443/blamef-stars-en-route-to-first-event-win-in-fnatic,"The Danish rifler dominated the grand final of RES Regional Series 6 Europe with a 1.71 rating. fnatic have won RES Regional Series 6 Europe after beating Passion UA 2-1 in the grand final, earning $50,000 for the first-place finish — a significant result ahead of Valve's final ranking update for the Shanghai Major qualifiers — and securing their first event win with Benjamin ""blameF"" Bremer. The 27-year-old joined the British organization in May after three months on Astralis' bench and hasn't missed a beat upon his return, averaging a 1.27 rating and 1.32 impact rating over 47 maps. The team missed the playoffs of CCT Global Finals upon his debut and faltered in a qualifier for BLAST Fall Showdown, but ended the first half of the year on the rise with a playoff run at YaLLa Compass and a runners-up finish to 9z at FiReLEAGUE Global Finals. That form has persisted out of the tournament break as the organization claimed its second RES Regional Series title, powered by a blameF in scalding form. The Dane posted a 1.24 series rating or higher across his team's five series victories, only dropping below that (1.16) in a loss to Zero Tenacity in the group stage. He dwarfed those numbers in the grand final, which he began by eviscerating Passion UA — who beat Ninjas in Pyjamas en route to the final — with a 2.14 rating (25-6 K-D, 122.5 ADR) on Nuke. A stellar CT side from him on the Ukrainian team's Mirage pick (2.07 rating, 17-4 K-D, 135.2 ADR) helped fnatic garner a 7-5 lead, but a flawless defense from Passion UA turned the map on its head as fnatic completely collapsed in the second half. blameF put on another defensive masterclass on the Ancient decider, posting a 2.12 CT rating, 18-5 K-D, and 123.5 ADR, but strong showings from Alexandre ""bodyy"" Pianaro and Matúš ""MATYS"" Šimko made it less of a one-man show this time as fnatic took a 9-3 lead. blameF fell away in the second half as Passion UA mounted a comeback effort, but MATYS and Aurélien ""afro"" Drapier stepped up with impactful multi-kill rounds to shut that down and close out for their side. RES Regional Series 6 Europe top eight: 1.  fnatic - $50,0002.  Passion UA - $25,0003-4.  Zero Tenacity - $12,5003-4.  MOUZ NXT - $12,5005-8.  B85-8.  Ninjas in Pyjamas5-8.  BLEED5-8.

Meta Monday: NAVI's perfectly timed push catches G2 off-guard,https://www.hltv.org/news/39442/meta-monday-navis-perfectly-timed-push-catches-g2-off-guard,"NAVI set up a bold play in the first gun round on Nuke in the EWC grand final as they fought back after an overtime loss in the series' opening map. The second map of the Esports World Cup final between Natus Vincere and G2 became a pivotal moment for the Ukrainian organization in their quest to lift the trophy as they sought to bring the match back to even on Nuke after letting Ancient slip between their fingers in overtime. To set the pace early on their map pick after going up 3-0 on the T side, Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and his men decided on a gutsy play in the first proper buy round — abusing Squeaky in a quick well-timed A hit —, which worked out and kept momentum on their side. Natus Vincere rarely abused the A site door on the first buy round in previous matches, which made their bold choice to hit early on in the grand final unpredictable. The action begins with Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov dropping his smoke next to the stairs near T spawn. Two crucial events that eventually shaped G2’s setups in the round then unfold. On the one hand, Mihai ""iM"" Ivan throws a smoke outside, next to Red, making it difficult for the CTs to know if someone is trying to sneak past it. Simultaneously, the rest of the team begin to apply pressure on the A site, suggesting that they might be about to launch an attack there. The combination of two mollies on top and in front of Hut prevents the CTs from swinging and checking what is happening. Additionally, the smoke on Main isolates Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, who just spams through it. The molly Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač threw in Squeaky at the beginning of the round is about to run out and G2 don't have a clue of what is going on. NiKo begins to worry about someone possibly lurking outside, Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov starts to rotate — probably to help outside —, and huNter- takes his utility out to block the gap in Squeaky. Meanwhile, iM is on his way back from Yard and grabs the smoke dropped by w0nderful at the beginning of the round to reload the smoke in Main. The timing is perfect; the CT molly on Squeaky is no longer there, the CTs are rotating back away from A, and Natus Vincere’s main pack are prepared for the push. w0nderful, taking over the supportive duties, starts flashing the A site from Roof while Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius and Aleksib head out onto the site and Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy waits patiently in Hut for the perfect moment to help his teammates. When the hit comes, the two nearest defenders, Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski and huNter- — the latter still scrambling to pull out his rifle after smoking Squeaky —, are blind and unable to react in time. m0NESY turns around to get back to A, but by the time he manages to do so, it's too late. NiKo is shot through the smoke in Main and dies, the bomb is planted shortly after, and Natus Vincere has full control of the site in the post-plant situation. With the courage of calling an A push in the first buy round with AKs, Natus Vincere set up the perfect conditions in the early rounds of Nuke to go on to win their pick and force a decider map.",22-7-2024 21:52,1721677920000
CS2 update introduces Dust2 Catwalk self-boost,https://www.hltv.org/news/39444/cs2-update-introduces-dust2-catwalk-self-boost,"Two players are no longer required to get up onto Catwalk quickly on the defense. Valve have released a small update for Counter-Strike 2, with the most prominent change being the modification of the crate stack near CT spawn on Dust2. Following this update, players can now reach Catwalk from the crate stack without the need for a second player to facilitate a boost. This update marks the first change to Dust2's layout since the map's addition to the competitive pool in place of Overpass in late April. Outside of the change to Dust2's crates, the update also includes clipping adjustments for Nuke, and updates to the newly-introduced workshop maps Assembly and Memento. Additionally, in-game trophies for the PGL Copenhagen Major have been distributed to the accounts of players who reached playoffs, a cause championed by Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius since his team's Major-winning campaign.",23-7-2024 02:55,1721696100000

Gaimin Gladiators have announced the additions of seasoned Danish players Fredrik ""roeJ"" Jørgensen and Nico ""nicoodoz"" Tamjidi, who will take the places of Jason ""salazar"" Salazar and Patrick ""Patti"" Larsen. The latter's departure means Magnus ""Nodios"" Olsen will take over as in-game leader, HLTV has learned. The Canadian organization returned to Counter-Strike in April by signing the ECSTATIC roster that broke out at PGL CS2 Major Copenhagen and entered the top 20 in the world rankings. After their signing, the team dropped to No. 40 in the rankings as they failed to build on the success of their Major run. Early exits in several online cups and a winless campaign at MESA Nomadic Masters Spring 2024, their only LAN tournament in their new home, prompted the organization to enact roster changes. nicoodoz comes into the team to take over AWPing duties after playing the first half of the year in HEROIC. The move marks the Dane's return to a team from his local scene where he first broke out with Copenhagen Flames. roeJ has been inactive since the disbandment of the Preasy squad earlier in April, where he averaged a 1.14 rating. The 30-year-old reunites with long-time teammate nicoodoz, with whom he played on Copenhagen Flames, fnatic, and Preasy. ""We got an opportunity to bring in two really good players who also bring a lot of experience,"" coach Peter ""casle"" Ardenskjold told HLTV.

"ISSAA: ""Counter-Strike is in my blood""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39439/issaa-counter-strike-is-in-my-blood,"The Jordanian spoke to HLTV about his return from VALORANT and future plans with JiJieHao. After transitioning away from the game in 2022 to focus on VALORANT, former HellRaisers and OG player Issa ""ISSAA"" Murad made his return to Counter-Strike this year. With JiJieHao, the Jordanian first attempted to qualify for PGL Major Copenhagen earlier in the year and has now played his first Big Event since 2019 with a revamped lineup featuring Markus ""Kjaerbye"" Kjærbye at the now-concluded Esports World Cup. JiJieHao's campaign in Saudi Arabia ended after just one map, as they were thrown into the last chance stage from the get-go and lost in the first round to Sashi. HLTV had the chance to catch up with the 27-year-old to discuss his comeback. He spoke about the reasons why he first initiated the transition to VALORANT and making a return to Counter-Strike after two years away, and shared his ultimate goal for the rest of the year — to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major. Read the full interview below: Your team got seeded into the last-chance best-of-one bracket, and you lost your match against Sashi, making this possibly the shortest Counter-Strike LAN run in many years. How does it feel that you had just one map at the event? I don't know. I hate to complain about stuff, and I have no idea why they chose to put us straight in the lower bracket. In the end, it's God's plan, I'm happy with what God gave us, it's okay. It was our first official in this roster. Everything was shaky. In the beginning we just need more official experience, and I wish we can play much better for sure in the future. After leaving Eternal Fire in 2021, you went to VALORANT. Why did you decision to make that transition? I had some stuff going on in my mind. It was COVID time, that period, and deep in my head I wanted to finish my university. If you are from the Middle East it is important to finish studying, it's a good weapon in your hand in the future. So I decided I would like to finish university and I knew that VALORANT did not have as many tournaments as CS has, so I could actually play the game, take income, and at the same time do my best and finish my university. I knew that if I stayed in CS and played at the top level I couldn't do both things at the same time. You have to travel all the time, you have a lot of tournaments, so this was my main point. How did it go? Did you get to finish your university, and how was your career in VALORANT? I played around 9-10 months in VALORANT. It was decent, but my main goal was my university, and I finally finished it during these two years with excellent rates, and I'm happy with this. No regrets. Why did you decide to come back to Counter-Strike? It was always in my head that I wanted to go back to CS. Inside me, I wanted to go back. After I finished university I saw that CS2 was coming, so I said, 'Okay, this is it for me.' When I posted on Twitter, I said I only wanted CS offers because it's in my blood, this game. Some players transitioned back and forth, like nitr0. Do you think there's any chance you will return to VALORANT in the future? I don't know what God decides for me, but for me as ISSAA I don't think I will do it because I like CS much more than VALORANT, and I tried both of them. CS needs more game sense, in a way, because VALORANT is a much easier game in some situations. They have abilities that can help you to play, for example you have Sentinel where you can put a rock behind you and you never care about the flank. But in CS you always have to rely on communication, about getting flank, you can play on timing much better in CS than in VALORANT. Can you tell us a little bit about JiJieHao? They have a history of featuring mixed teams with cores from the Middle East to play the regional qualifiers. Can you tell me how this works? On what conditions were you invited into this team? What are your goals in this team, and does this organization operate on a per-event basis, or is there a bigger plan in mind? We have a bigger plan in mind. Right now our focus is on the next RMR, to win the closed qualifier in MENA and then go to the RMR, and hopefully we qualify since it's three slots at the Major right now. This is our main goal right now. In the future, we'd like to play more events for sure and to get more official experience. As you see, we practiced these months, but then you come and you just play one best-of-one. Every top player knows that when you make a team at the start, you know mistakes will happen when you play officials. Every team needs official experience before they start to achieve in the long term. So what are your plans after this event? You talked about the RMR, but there is some time before it happens. What are you going to do in the next couple of months? We will have full preparation. Our main goal is the RMR as I said. We will have around three weeks, I guess. I think we will have some rest now, around one week, but we will see after that. Maybe we'll play some events before the RMR, but I'm not sure yet about it. I have not spoken with my team, and I don't know. But our main goal is to practice for the RMR. Maybe we will get more invitations to these tier-two events, so it's 50/50 right now. Maybe we just need a better ranking to play in these events and get invitations to them. You're playing with Kjaerbye now. What are your impressions? He is obviously a Major winner, a Major MVP, had a bumpy career in the last couple of years. How does it feel to play with him now? I've known Kjaerbye for way, way longer. During the time when I played with HellRaisers and OG, I played against him a lot and at events we were having a friendship, so I kinda know his personality. In my opinion he's a really good player. Right now we just need more official experience in order for him to pump again. I'm happy to play with him.",23-7-2024 16:15,1721744100000

Stat check: Cloud9 finally settle on a five,https://www.hltv.org/news/39400/stat-check-cloud9-finally-settle-on-a-five,"A difficult three-month rebuild is complete, so what is the new Cloud9's ceiling? Cloud9's move for Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov and Ilya ""Perfecto"" Zalutskiy was supposed to change things for the better. The duo were known quantities, Major champions with Natus Vincere, and fit their new team's positions like a glove. But we all learned a lesson from them last year. First, Cloud9 lacked a true in-game leader as electroNic struggled with the role. Then, once Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov departed the team, they lacked a true AWPer. Sniper and captain are the two most important roles in the game. Even a rifle core of Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov (albeit not in his best form), Abay ""HObbit"" Khassenov, electroNic, and Perfecto could not overcome Cloud9's holes in those areas. So, the superteam failed. What now? It is immediately obvious that Cloud9 are not shopping off the top shelf. Spirit and Virtus.pro are both unpoachable, but so are some of the teams directly below them. According to a post by insider Alexey ""OverDrive"" Birukov on Telegram, the list of players who rejected trials for Cloud9 include Timur ""clax"" Sabirov, Aleksandr ""zorte"" Zagodyrenko, Kirill ""Magnojez"" Rodnov, Artem ""ArtFr0st"" Kharitonov, and Aleksandr ""shalfey"" Marenov. Good players, but hardly household names. In the end, with help from Dmitry ""hooch"" Bogdanov, Konstantin ""groove"" Pikiner got his men. Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko, who has both Ukrainian and Russian heritage, was the first man to sign up and is a big coup as a specialist anchor with a 1.16 rating in 2024 (though that drops to 1.03 on LAN). Kaisar ""ICY"" Faiznurov, a raw but talented Kazakh teenager, controversially arrived from AMKAL to take over the AWP. Finally, Timofey ""interz"" Yakushin, the support player from the old Gambit Youngsters core, returns to play with his former teammate Ax1Le. Immediately, the composition presents questions. Ax1Le and HeavyGod are similar players on the CT side, overqualified anchors who both take up similar spots: A on Ancient, Pit on Inferno, B on Vertigo, and so on. The addition of interz, a pure supportive element, also means it is not as simple as one of Ax1Le or HeavyGod just swapping a big site anchor role for a small site. One of the three has to take up the star rotation positions, if not two. This is true on the T side, as well, where all three riflers were lurkers in the first half of 2024. Ax1Le and HeavyGod are both fairly aggressive when necessary, but the former has more of a star space-taker profile akin to that of players who have dominated in CS2. At his 2020-22 peak, when he was among the top five in the Top 20 Player of the Year awards in 2021 and 2022, Ax1Le was commonly compared to Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, and for good reason. It is easier to imagine Ax1Le solo-taking places like Banana on Inferno and Middle on Ancient than his new Israeli teammate. In the PUGs they have played together as a five, however, the role has been shared: Ax1Le is the Middle aggressor on Ancient, but HeavyGod has been taking Middle on Mirage, and Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov was the primary Outside player on Nuke. There have been shuffles on the CT side, too. Ax1Le has moved from Short to Conn on Mirage, and A to Middle on Ancient in a clear designation of star status. This may change, given that these are only casual games, but it does paint a picture of the role overlap. Not many teams that share roles around on the T side reach maximum comfort in them. The new five's trading profile helps explain some of this: HeavyGod is a lone wolf, preferring to be alone and scoring low in traded kills and traded deaths. Ax1Le, by contrast, is in the top right of the chart, where we usually find players like Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets. This suggests he will go in front of their teammates if it is favorable (and thus get plenty of traded deaths) and behind when it is not (giving him lots of trade kills, too). interz, as we have said, is that primary support and will happily entry into bomb sites from his lurker roles. Boombl4's aggression needs no introduction. This data suggests that Ax1Le is a more natural map control player than HeavyGod, as he would be able to take space solo or bait Boombl4 for some easy frags. Ax1Le is also more aggressive in terms of openers than HeavyGod, though their proximity on this chart shows they are both capable of opening. Ultimately, we will have to wait and see, but these two charts show why positions are not the be-all and end-all. HeavyGod and Ax1Le share multiple positions, but that does not mean they are identical players. HeavyGod deserves more of a deep dive. The 21-year-old took the well-trodden path out of Israeli CS to Endpoint before signing for OG in January of this year and quickly impressed despite his team's struggles. HeavyGod earned a 1.11 rating overall despite losing more maps than he won. He was particularly impressive on Ancient (1.25 rating), Mirage (1.22), and Anubis (1.20), and won 27 clutches in his 71 map sample. We have mentioned his drop-off on LAN, where a 0.83 rating during his BLAST Spring Groups debut in January hurts his average, but he did post 1.10 ratings at the PGL Major Copenhagen RMR and GET Rio. The question is: What zenith can HeavyGod reach in this Cloud9 lineup? With Ax1Le likely to change roles and ICY being such a diamond in the rough, the pressure will be on HeavyGod to deliver the star power the team needs — a tough ask. Still, his talent shouldn't be overlooked. Posting 81 ADR in a team that struggled as much as OG did should not be underestimated, even if some of it comes from a bit of baiting his less talented teammates. As far as question marks go, there aren't many. There is a reason he was at the top of many people's lists as a replacement for Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros on Liquid or Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković on G2. The title of biggest question mark goes to ICY, the AWPer Cloud9 selected after trying out Beksultan ""khaN"" Ospan and being denied by zorte and ArtFr0st. ICY had a decent RMR debut, including a 28-frag showing against Falcons, but his rookie status was obvious throughout and his coach didn't let him off the hook after their elimination. ""ICY is our biggest talent at the moment, he has a lot of potential,"" AMKAL's coach, Svyatoslav ""svyat"" Dovbakh, said. ""He has a very cold head, a cold mind, and he keeps calm in hard situations. He's really good individually but makes a lot of mistakes that cost our team rounds. ""I guess we just need to work with him together, me and him, to improve him because he is not ready to play at big events at the moment. He really has good potential. I'm sure he'll be ready in half a year or so."" It was hardly a ringing endorsement for a player whose talent was already attracting attention, and the 19-year-old also got in hot water for how he departed AMKAL. The organization launched an investigation into his conduct, allegedly for trying out with Cloud9 without his team's permission. It ultimately came to nothing when an agreement was reached for his transfer. But ICY did not earn a 1.14 rating against top 20 opponents over 22 maps this year by accident. He will provide the AWPing presence that Cloud9 lacked so much since sh1ro's departure, a true sniper with 47.2% of his 2024 kills coming with the big green. That amounts to a multi-kill with the AWP in 9% of rounds, and an opener with the sniper in 6% (meaning two-thirds of his openers come on the AWP). He is also an able trade-fragger (0.17 per round) and has the talent to hit the tricky re-frags after following the pack into a bomb site. A lot of his traits are ones you expect from a modern sniper. He's fairly passive, throws a lot of utility during executes, is very calm in the clutch, and is more about posting up for easy kills than outrageous Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov-style flicks. Cloud9's ceiling as a team will largely depend on how far ICY can develop. The team's template for success is a stable base of fragging from HeavyGod, Ax1Le enjoying a resurgence in new roles, and ICY providing the clutches and round-winning multi-frags that his $4750 weapon demands. There is also a huge onus on Boombl4. Even if that trio does perform well, this is not a team with the firepower to make deep runs without an exceptional tactical base. It's a rebuild that is far less glamorous than spending a couple of millions on electroNic and Perfecto, and it's not one that will excite the organization's core North American fanbase. Instead, these are sensible transfers in a difficult market where Cloud9 was not an organization able to get their first choices. The core's age has been slashed to 22.6, and there's plenty of resale value in the high-potential duo of HeavyGod and ICY. Being a general manager in CS these days ultimately boils down to two scenarios: Go all-out to win everything, or spend as little as possible on a team that will still qualify for the Major and earn the coveted sticker money. Cloud9 tried the first, and now they are trying the second.",24-7-2024 15:01,1721826060000
Playoff race wide open after smooth day two at Skyesports Championship,https://www.hltv.org/news/39451/playoff-race-wide-open-after-smooth-day-two-at-skyesports-championship,"Eternal Fire and The MongolZ lead their groups after the first full day of the round-robin group stage, but it's still anyone's game. After an issue-laden first day at Skyesports Championship, which saw just one best-of-one played before the remaining matches were postponed and resulted in BetBoom dropping out, day two has gone off without a hitch. The event resumed with the specter of an ultimatum hanging over the Indian tournament organizer: BLEED's head coach, Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović, revealed that teams told Skyesports that they would pull out of the event and go home in case there were any more long delays. In a follow-up post after the matches concluded, the Serbian coach stated that the ""whole day went smoothly"" and that he ""didn’t hear a single complaint."" Nine best-of-one matches were played on day two of the round-robin stage, with kassad's BLEED posting a 1-1 record in Group A. The team suffered a blowout loss to ENCE and grabbed a close win over True Rippers, who came back from a 1-8 start on Anubis to lead 10-8 but couldn't close out. The Indian team gave The MongolZ a fright on day one, drumming up an 11-5 lead on Ancient, but Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren's men won eight rounds straight to scrape together a win. The MongolZ failed to keep a clean sheet on the second day of play, however, getting upset by PARIVISION on Mirage before dominating ENCE on the same map to remain atop the group — for now. Eternal Fire comfortably dispatched of DMS and Revenant, living up to their status as favorites in Group B, but aren't locked in for playoffs yet with matches against 3DMAX and AMKAL ahead. The Frenchmen narrowly prevailed over Vladislav ""Krad"" Kravchenko and company in overtime on Nuke, an important win in the event of any tiebreaker scenario, with AMKAL recovering with a clean win over DMS that kept them in the top three heading into day three. Two days of round-robin action are still to unfold, but some teams could start locking in playoff berths as early as their next match. Eternal Fire are chief among that list, courtesy of BetBoom's withdrawal leaving Group B with only five teams, with only a win over AMKAL separating them from a playoff spot.

YaLLa reveals $1.5m 2025 circuit with 2 LAN finals,https://www.hltv.org/news/39453/yalla-reveals-15m-2025-circuit-with-2-lan-finals,"The Emirati tournament organizer adds two LAN finals to an already-packed 2025 tournament circuit. YaLLa Esports, the company behind YaLLa Compass, has announced the return of its tournament circuit for 2025. The news follows the conclusion of YaLLa Compass 2024, where The MongolZ claimed victory over Ninjas in Pyjamas in the grand final to win the lion's share of a $400,000 prize pool. The United Arab Emirates-based tournament organizer has ""two S-tier LAN events planned across the MENA Middle East and North Africa region"" offering a combined $1.5 million prize pool, and revealed to HLTV that the first LAN final is scheduled to run from April 15-20. Open qualifiers for the tournament will kick off on July 29, 2024, ""with two additional open qualifiers planned for Q4 2024 and Q1 2025."" The qualifying format is similar to the process used by YaLLa for its Compass 2024 tournament, which featured Spring and Fall ""Contenders"" stages from which the top eight teams advanced to the ""Main"" stage. Both stages will feature a 16-team, best-of-three Swiss group stage, with the latter culminating in a single-elimination, best-of-three playoff bracket. Unlike the 2024 circuit, however, the Main stage no longer qualifies the winning team directly to the LAN final. Instead, the top two teams from each Main stage will earn spots in a new closed qualifier that will play out in the leadup to the main event. The dates for the first set of qualifiers can be found below: Contenders Swiss Stage: July 29-August 22, 2024 Main Swiss Stage: August 26-September 19, 2024 Playoffs: September 23-25, 2024 The additional of two YaLLa Compass tournaments brings the total number of events in 2025 up to a staggering 25, with the Emirati organizer's first LAN final slotting in to the only free days in between a PGL-hosted tournament and an ESL-hosted tournament. The calendar for 2025 now looks as follows, with the second YaLLa Compass tournament speculatively slotted into the only gap near the end of the year: January 13-26 - BLAST tournamentJanuary 29-February 9 - ESL tournamentFebruary 10-23 - PGL tournamentFebruary 25-March 16 - ESL tournamentMarch 17-30 - BLAST tournamentMarch 31-April 13 - PGL tournamentApril 15-20 - YaLLa Compass tournamentApril 21-27 - ESL tournamentApril 28-May 4 - BLAST tournamentMay 5-18 - PGL tournamentMay 19-25 - ESL tournamentMay 26-June 1 - StarLadder tournamentJune 9-22 - First MajorJuly 23-August 3 - ESL tournamentAugust 4-17 - BLAST tournamentAugust 20-24 - ESL tournamentAugust 25-September 7 - BLAST tournamentSeptember 12-21 - StarLadder tournamentSeptember 23-October 12 - ESL tournamentSeptember 29-October 12 - PGL tournamentUnknown date - YaLLa Compass tournamentOctober 18-November 2 - PGL tournamentNovember 3-9 - ESL tournamentNovember 10-16 - BLAST tournamentDecember 1-14 - Second Major",24-7-2024 21:57,1721851020000

The EVPs and Best Five of Esports World Cup,https://www.hltv.org/news/39450/the-evps-and-best-five-of-esports-world-cup,"w0nderful and jL got EVPs as NAVI lifted the trophy and pushed their earnings beyond $1M in 2024. The second half of 2024 is underway, and it has begun with Natus Vincere returning to winning ways in style after the summer break. The Major champions were under pressure to prove that their victory in Copenhagen was not a fluke, and that pressure is now being alleviated after a grand final appearance at the BLAST Spring Final and a victory at EWC on either side of the summer break. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy was the key man in the Major final despite a bumpy tournament overall. Here, at EWC, he had enough pre-final form that another fantastic performance in the final let him surge to his first-ever MVP award. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač has exploded into life recently, earning two EVPs in three events, but he will be wondering what could have been in the grand final against Natus Vincere. After three very strong series G2's star rifler was the clear favorite to take home the MVP medal, which would have been his first since August 2023, before the title decider. NiKo's standout performance came in the semi-final against Virtus.pro, where he recorded a whopping 2.49 rating (26-6 K-D, 151.4 ADR) in a 13-4 stomping on Dust2. Natus Vincere, however, put a stop to his run of form. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen called rings around his former team, avoiding NiKo's B site on Inferno with five Apps pops in one half, and kept him to a 1.13 rating in the final. That let b1t creep past him in the MVP race, but make no mistake: NiKo is back. Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov was next to NiKo as the pre-final favorites for the MVP, but was forced into the back seat as b1t and Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius took over the final with their rifles. That should not take away from his form beforehand, including separate 1.69 and 2.01 ratings in NAVI's two map wins over MOUZ. He was also impressive against FaZe, and ended the tournament with a 1.46 CT Rating, 0.81 KPR, and 0.15 opening KPR (far above his usual opener average). You can tell by Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo's full radar that the Finn was on a tear in Saudi Arabia. The only gap in his tournament was the level of his opposition: Sashi and FURIA were solid, and did challenge MOUZ, but both were outside of the top 15 and became an asterisk to Jimpphat's staggering raw numbers. He was also solid against Natus Vincere in the semis, top-fragging in the 13-1 Dust2 win over the tournament winners, but he could not climb higher up the list. jL completes the EVP list after having the highest rating in the grand final, which further enhances his reputation as one of CS2's certified big game players. He now has a 1.24 arena rating for 2024, dropping to 1.18 in elimination games and to 1.13 overall — that makes a 0.11 point improvement in the highest-pressure moments. His frags were also high-impact all tournament long, with 78% of them being converted into round wins. In 75% of NAVI's round wins, jL got either a kill or an assist. Aleksib, who led Natus Vincere to a 59.0% T side round win rate, joins our top four EVPs to create a bonafide superteam. Alongside b1t and w0nderful, NiKo is slotted in for Mihai ""iM"" Ivan and Jimpphat for jL to break up Natus Vincere's five, which make the average rating of our four fraggers 1.35 at the event. jL's big plays and aggressive lurks would be missed in this structure, but who can turn down NiKo and Jimpphat after their performances? Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa's G2 debut was a good one, showing his extreme technical skill despite a full role change on CT and plenty of bomb-site entry pathing to navigate on T. He had a 1.26 rating in G2's map wins, and was close to an EVP had his final continued in the same vein as map one. Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali was also close, after he dominated Vitality en route to Virtus.pro securing back-to-back Big Event semi-finals. The other key story from this event concerns the Player of the Year race. Only Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut emerged with much positive credit after a disastrous final from Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets's finishing his first event with a negative KD since joining Spirit. None of the three earn EVPs, and the same is true for 2024's early frontrunners, Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský. Much is still to play for.",25-7-2024 15:00,1721912400000

Aurora and Eternal Fire top groups at Skyesports Championship,https://www.hltv.org/news/39458/aurora-and-eternal-fire-top-groups-at-skyesports-championship,"The Turkish team went through its group unbeaten, though its last match went down to overtime.

Stat check: Liquid tighten the pursestrings for their fourth rebuild in three years,https://www.hltv.org/news/39394/stat-check-liquid-tighten-the-pursestrings-for-their-fourth-rebuild-in-three-years,"After Liquid's cadiaN-led superteam failed, they made yet another double swap and landed on Twistzz becoming the in-game leader. Since 2022, when Liquid began the year with a triple transfer, they have had ten players and three coaches sport their jersey in official matches. The arrival of Justin ""jks"" Savage, Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak, and Torbjørn ""mithR"" Nyborg brings that total to twelve players and four coaches in just two-and-a-half years. Flux has become the norm, as project after project collapses every six months. There have been good spells in that timespan. Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis's arrival saw Liquid climb to third place in the world and reach two Big Event grand finals at the end of 2022. But six months later, after a bad Major, that lineup — the organization's last somewhat stable effort — collapsed as two franchise players synonymous with the Liquid brand, Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski and Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella, left the team. Since then, Liquid have tried multiple routes and have become one of many international sides: Moneyball low-spending on Robert ""Patsi"" Isyanov and Aleks ""Rainwaker"" Petrov, a promising rookie in Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros, and big name known quantities like Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller and Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken. Only Twistzz's signing, a player who had already succeeded in Liquid before, can be termed a success. One hit, four misses; hardly a record to be proud of. It makes sense that Liquid have handed full control to Twistzz in their latest rebuild. The Canadian superstar, North America's greatest-ever player for many, will take on in-game leadership as he seeks to wrestle the organization up the standings. But after expensive misses in the transfer market on cadiaN and skullz, he will have to do so with a roster built with a min-max mindset. jks, a free agent, has replaced skullz, and ultimate, a Polish 20-year-old who is yet to play a top 30 team in 2024, has come in to be the new sniper. Role-wise, it's a perfect fit to have jks replace skullz as a passive lurker-anchor. jks will now share that responsibility of lurking on T and anchoring on CT with Keith ""NAF"" Markovic, leaving Twistzz, YEKINDAR, and ultimate as the side's early-round playmakers on both sides of the map. When cadiaN was benched, one option was to sign a new rifling in-game leader , putting NAF into skullz's role as the primary lurker and returning Twistzz to his FaZe roles as the flexible half-lurker on T. You can see the structure had a player like Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen arrived, with Twistzz and NAF as the passive duo and YEKINDAR freed to create space on his own terms with HooXi as the sacrificial bomb-site entry. But the one benefit of the last roster has been the form of Twistzz in his new in-game leader style roaming T side roles: Ones he was always keen to try out. ""When you have an AWPer IGL, it opens up a unique rifler role that usually would be the in-game leader,"" Twistzz explained in January. ""For me, it's interesting that it's the role that I've always wanted, to be in this true flex position where I can use my actual best qualities, which I feel is being complimentary between sites."" In this role, he has a 1.18 rating on LAN in 2024 (1.09 on T, 1.26 on CT) and has complete freedom — freedom he did not want to give up by changing into a more natural IGL like HooXi. That left Liquid needing an anchor, which explains why they chose to replace skullz one-for-one, first by chasing Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato again before opting for jks instead. jks' 2023 stats maps onto skullz's 2024 remarkably well, with similarly low overall output in terms of kills and damage but excellent survival. Stats do not always show the nuances of the anchor and support role, and jks' experience will be key as he actively prowls on T side and puts in work in his specialist CT spots like Pit on Inferno or A on Mirage. But a player as passive as jks means that Liquid will maintain the role composition and aggression balance that caught them off guard so often in the roster under cadiaN. YEKINDAR remains the only natural aggressive rifler, with three passive riflers in Twistzz, NAF, and jks all preferring to be alive in the late round. ultimate, online and against weaker opposition, was more aggressive than cadiaN, but this will not change anything on T-side executes. YEKINDAR's form has been under huge scrutiny ever since he first dipped into in-game leadership himself in 2023, going from the eighth-best player of 2021 and 15th in 2022 to a 1.05 LAN rating and 0.93 K/D in 2024. In 2024 he was too often a bomb-site entry going at a completely different pace to his team. jks' arrival will not change that, either: this is something the team must solve together. There is also a reason that most teams opt for one aggressive lurker, and one more passive one: David ""frozen"" Čerňanský and Robin ""ropz"" Kool, Ludvig ""Brollan"" Brolin and Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo, Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaarda and Alexander ""br0"" Bro being three examples. jks and NAF, meanwhile, are almost exact replicas — something that was a problem when they played together in Renegades in 2017 under Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović. ""After a month and a half of NAF being on Renegades, jks came to me and told me, 'I feel lost, I don't know what I'm doing on the maps. I want to go home,'"" kassad recalled on Hot Take Point Made. ""Liquid getting jks means two things: Either he forgot about Renegades, or he offered to play more aggressive roles which is ... not going to be a thing. It's not in jks' game — he's played the same way for 15 years. ""He's crazy passive and you can't have two players like that. The game is more dynamic."" jks and NAF are both good players, reliable anchors who overperform in their positions. But it is not certain they can co-exist without a change to one of their games, six years on from last playing with each other. The rifling core is full of experience. All four have been Top 20 Players of the Year, but that is no guarantee of success in a new game — one that jks has played just seven times in officials. We have also barely mentioned the fifth player, a completely unknown quantity in the form of ultimate. A prodigy who impressed Jarosław ""pashaBiceps"" Jarząbkowski at PGC when he was just 17, ultimate made a leap in form on CS2, going from a 1.03 rating in CS:GO to a 1.16 in the new game. ""In 2021, during the camp, he was known as a modest, polite, and quiet boy,"" pashaBiceps commented. ""He stood out as a boy with a passion for CS and a clear vision of what he wants to do in life."" While jks is a straight swap for skullz, the same cannot be said for ultimate and cadiaN. ""His greatest strength is getting opening kills in the early stages of the round,"" his former AGO and Illuminar skipper, Damian ""Furlan"" Kislowski, told HLTV. ""In AGO, he was more withdrawn and afraid to take the initiative. Currently, in CS2, I think he is a more complete player who is not afraid to take the game into his own hands."" He continued, ""I would compare his style to ZywOo because he is a person who likes to initiate the round and can win it by himself. He feels equally comfortable with a rifle as with an AWP."" High praise, indeed. The stats back this up, with 0.07 openers per round with sniper rifles and 0.13 overall in 2024. ultimate is far more of a raw fragger (0.75 KPR, 19% multi-kills) than the Dane. These numbers, of course, came against very weak opposition. ultimate's signing, in that sense, is one that hopes to match Ninjas in Pyjamas' pick of Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz, an aggressive tier two sniper with great raw figures. But not everyone can jump to tier one like r1nkle has. It is far more common for AWPers to shrink, to not go for the picks that worked in tier two, and struggle to match their old output against far more disciplined players. That risk is always present in Moneyball signings, whatever the role. It was there for Liquid when they signed Rainwaker and had to bench him after just a few months. ""His biggest weakness was probably not communicating in tough situations,"" Tal ""meztal"" Hahiashvili told us after praising his former teammate's aggression and versatility on the rifle. ""But apparently, there are a lot of  tier one players who struggle with that, and their teammates are comming instead of them in those situations."" With limited funds and an absence of other AWPers — alternative players include the likes of Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk, Iulian ""regali"" Harjău, Olek ""hades"" Miskiewicz, and Emil ""sL1m3"" Stolz —, you can see why Liquid took the gamble. It's a signing that shows a desire to find an AWPer who is more involved in openers, happier to be part of the trading pack rather than a pure utility man like cadiaN, and at a low cost. Signing Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev was never going to happen. Liquid's new composition is, therefore, the same as the roster with skullz: Four experienced professionals alongside one rookie who will need to be taken under someone's wing. Data is only one part of the puzzle. Liquid's new coach, mithR, has the tough brief of guiding Twistzz through a new journey as an in-game leader, helping NAF or jks — or both — develop more aggression, and of molding ultimate into a tier one player. All in all, it is a tough task for a coach who is well-respected but does not have too many results to boast in stints at North, MOUZ, and Apeks. Liquid tried the superteam, where the personalities and in-game styles of YEKINDAR, Twistzz, Wilton ""zews"" Prado, and cadiaN clashed to create a roster that could not even qualify for the Major. The new roster is not as exciting on paper, but has a trimmed leadership group of Twistzz and YEKINDAR (who were already doing a lot of the strategy according to Duncan ""Thorin"" Shields) and lower pressure. Even the most positive fan, though, will have winced slightly upon hearing that Twistzz, still at the peak of his powers, has taken up the captaincy. The Canadian is the new team's most recognizable face and best player, and now he must also be their leader. It will be his job to deliver feedback well, sacrifice individual hours for team prep, pick up players after losses, take on extra media duty, and perform plenty of other unenviable tasks traditional in-game leaders are used to. You only need to compare him to Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, who won IEM Dallas as an in-game leader but did not want to become one full-time after HooXi's departure in the understanding that he had more to give. In some ways, Liquid played this off-season safe with a free jks and a cheap ultimate, but by making Twistzz the team's captain, they are risking more than money; they are risking the form of the one bright spark of the team's 2024 thus far.",26-7-2024 15:02,1721998920000

The MongolZ and 3DMAX march on in Mumbai,https://www.hltv.org/news/39461/the-mongolz-and-3dmax-march-on-in-mumbai,"ENCE and AMKAL have been eliminated at the quarter-final stage. The MongolZ needed a 10-round second half to come back from 10-3 and beat AMKAL 2-0 and continue their run at Skyesports Championship. The Mongolian team's win puts them on a collision course with Eternal Fire to create a mouthwatering semi-final between the two highest-ranked teams at the LAN in India. Elsewhere, 3DMAX eliminated ENCE to set up a bout with Aurora. The Mongolians are the highest-ranked team in attendance, 12th in the world, but were not guaranteed to make playoffs after two defeats in the group stage at the hands of BLEED and PARIVISION. They also came close to an embarrassing upset to True Rippers in their opening bout after going down 11-6 before a lengthy technical pause allowed them to reset and defeat the Indian squad 13-11. That comeback spirit was needed again in the playoffs despite a comfortable map one victory as AMKAL were running away with proceedings on Mirage. But with Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold on fire, the comeback was completed on the CT side as The MongolZ once again turned it on when required. The second semi-final pitted 3DMAX against ENCE, and kicked off with the French side dominating Dust2. Lucas ""Lucky"" Chastang was in fine form with 20 frags and 114 ADR, as the 13-5 win was confirmed with a 6-0 T half for 3DMAX. Map two, 3DMAX's pick of Ancient, was far closer on paper with a 6-6 first half and the teams reaching 10-10 and 11-11 scorelines. In the end, however, 3DMAX's dominance was clear in the gun rounds – ENCE won both pistols — and ENCE continued their dire second half form by picking up just two more rounds after leading 9-6.",27-7-2024 19:15,1722100500000
MOUZ and Spirit among teams announced for BetBoom Dacha,https://www.hltv.org/news/39462/mouz-and-spirit-among-teams-announced-for-betboom-dacha,"FISSURE has announced another season of BetBoom Dacha, which will again take place in Belgrade. Fissure has announced another iteration of its BetBoom Dacha tournament, which will once again be a $500,000 affair in Belgrade. The tournament's dates are penciled in for August 25-September 1, although the tournament organizer noted that they could be slightly changed. Six teams have already received invites, including the last iteration's finalists, MOUZ and Spirit. The rest of the first wave of invites went to Virtus.pro, Aurora, BetBoom, and FURIA. Two more slots are available from qualifiers in Europe and South America, and four more invites are still to be handed out for a total of 12 teams. The group stage will feature double-elimination best-of-three groups with $10,000 going to the winners. It will be followed by a best-of-three double-elimination bracket with a best-of-five grand final. Of the invited teams, Spirit, MOUZ, and Virtus.pro are going straight to the playoffs, and one of the unannounced invites will also go to a team joining the fray after the group stage. The team list so far is: Complexity's general manager, Graham Pitt, took to X to open a discussion about how his team was not invited to the event (despite being higher in the ranking than many of the invited teams), and how they are unable to qualify for it from their home region since the only qualifiers are in Europe and South America.",27-7-2024 22:00,1722110400000
"karrigan: ""We lack the killer instinct we had in '22 and '23 in big games""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39464/karrigan-we-lack-the-killer-instinct-we-had-in-22-and-23-in-big-games,"The Danish captain opened up about the team's current struggles and ropz's slump in form. FaZe travel to Copenhagen hoping to build some momentum ahead of IEM Cologne, the next Big Event on the calendar. For the international team, there has been disappointment after disappointment since their IEM Chengdu title, with the Esports World Cup being the fourth tournament in a row in which they couldn't make it past the quarter-finals. After reaching the finals at their first seven Counter-Strike 2 LAN events, the team has looked surprisingly vulnerable and even disconnected at times. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen, who has taken most of the blame for his team's recent shortcomings, put the streak of quarter-final finishes down to a ""lack of confidence."" ""We have tried to improve some stuff we talked about after Dallas,"" he told HLTV during media day at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups. ""But in the end, we have to win games. We're not scared of the pressure, we're not playing any different, but when not everyone is confident on the team, taking duels and playing at the hardest level, it's going to be hard to win any quarter-final match. The competition is so high. ""And I think the teams we're losing to are not bad teams at all. That's a key factor that we put ourselves in a situation where we have to win these matches and we are not capable right now, to kind of use our confidence for the finals push. ""I still think we are making the matches tight and exciting, but we lack that killer instinct we had in 2022 and 2023 in the big games. Right now, that's something we need to work on, but it's very hard to force a killer instinct or confidence. We have to go back to the basics, work well in practice and feel confident coming into tournaments."" Perhaps the most worrying thing for FaZe right now is getting Robin ""ropz"" Kool back to his normal self. The Estonian has looked a shadow of himself, averaging only a 1.09 rating in the last six months. He had at the Esports World Cup his first below-average tournament rating (0.95) since joining FaZe in 2022. ""I think the most important thing is to acknowledge you're in a slump, not just as a player, but as a team,"" karrigan said. ""ropz has been in slumps before. Maybe this one has gone longer than what he is used to. But if you can come through that, you're going to be greater as a player. ""Every player in every single sport has had slumps. It depends on how you come out on the other side. The most important thing is to keep doing what you do and keep believing in what you're doing. And at some point, things are going to change. When you come out on the other side, it's going to feel great. But right now, it's hard as a team or as any player to find a way out. Like, looking at the light at the end of the tunnel, you can see it but you're not getting any closer. ""I think that's the most mentally draining thing. Right now, we're trying to do everything we can to help him. But in the end, he's the one sitting at the PC. It's him who has to believe in himself. I know for sure everyone on our team believes in him. We have seen how great he is. We know how great he is. I have played with him for so many years. So I believe he will find a way back and hopefully, it will be sooner than later because he is an important part of the team. ""He knows we're there for him and we're doing everything we can to make him as comfortable as possible. And that's the main thing about being part of a team. You try to help the ones that are feeling a little low on confidence. But as a team, we have to feel confident all the time."" FaZe will begin their BLAST Premier Groups campaign on Wednesday against the new-look Cloud9 team in the first round of Group C, which also includes G2 and Ninjas in Pyjamas. Despite his team struggling with some uncharacteristic mistakes in their recent tournaments, karrigan insisted that nothing has changed about the way they're playing the game. ""I think the lack of coordination can come down to many things,"" he said. ""Sometimes, it can be we're not understanding the gaps and taking the right timings. Sometimes, it can come down to team communication. I think that in every quarter-final exit, there were different issues, and you're trying to work through them. ""When I see us, how we played one year ago and how we play now, it's simply a lack of a killer instinct and confidence as a team. I think the most important thing we had when we played really well was that we believed in every single player to win a round. So people just went for stuff and tried to do something that's maybe uncoordinated on the fly, and it would work. ""But right now, when we're not shooting as hard, or moving as well, or reacting as fast, I can understand why it might look uncoordinated sometimes. But that's also the we way we've been playing. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and it didn't for the most part in the last two tournaments. ""But we're trying to create a better foundation to be able to overcome this when we're playing our B-game. Because if you want to win tournaments, sometimes your B-game has to be good enough to beat the other team's A-game.""",28-7-2024 15:27,1722173220000
3DMAX trounce The MongolZ to win Skyesports Championship,https://www.hltv.org/news/39465/3dmax-trounce-the-mongolz-to-win-skyesports-championship,"The French organization has secured its first notable LAN win in almost six years. 3DMAX have emerged victorious in the final of Skyesports Championship 2024, besting event-favorites The MongolZ to lay claim to the tournament's $120,000 grand prize. Bryan ""Maka"" Canda's troops entered the quarter-finals of the event with a 3-1 group stage record, facing just a single overtime loss at the hands of Eternal Fire.

A well-played 1v3 from Pierre ""Ex3rcice"" Bulinge in the second pistol was the nail in the coffin for The MongolZ on Anubis, as 3DMAX bagged their pick with a 13-4 scoreline. The MongolZ's pick of Ancient began in a far more competitive fashion, with 3DMAX eking out a 7-5 lead at halftime after starting with a 1-4 deficit, but Maka's men failed to drop a round in the second half, snagging a 13-5 scoreline, and along with it, the Skyesports Championship 2024 trophy.",28-7-2024 19:45,1722188700000

Sangal have claimed victory in CCT Season 2 Europe Series 6, taking down fellow international side fnatic in the final with a 2-1 scoreline after pulling off a reverse sweep. Sangal's CCT victory comes just a week after their quarter-final elimination from RES Regional Series 6 Europe, where Linus ""LNZ"" Holtäng's troops were sent packing from the online event at the hands of fnatic, who would go on to win the tournament after claiming further wins over MOUZ NXT and Passion UA.

After besting CCT S2 Europe Series 5 champs B8 in the quarter-finals, Sangal then took down Monte to snag their place in the grand final. The hard-fought final between Sangal and fnatic kicked off on the latter side's map pick of Dust2, where neither team was able to grasp a firm lead in the first half, culminating in a 6-6 scoreline at the side swap. A pistol round win for fnatic allowed them to wrest control of the lead, and although Sangal came close to securing overtime, Alexandre ""bodyy"" Pianaro's troops went on to finish off their pick 13-11. Sangal bounced back on their pick of Anubis, storming ahead in the first half after an early 1-3 deficit to finish with an 8-4 scoreline. fnatic once again pieced together a strong second half, even managing to briefly take the lead on the defense, but Sangal narrowly emerged the victors to take the series to Ancient. The deciding map of Ancient proved to be by far the least competitive of the series, as fnatic struggled to contend with a well-put-together CT-side from LNZ's squad, allowing Sangal to take an 8-4 lead at the half.

"mithR: ""Twistzz has the potential to be one of the best IGLs we've ever seen""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39466/mithr-twistzz-has-the-potential-to-be-one-of-the-best-igls-weve-ever-seen,"The Danish coach also shared his first impressions of ultimate and jks. New Liquid coach Torbjørn ""mithR"" Nyborg has heaped praise on Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken, saying that he believes the Canadian player can become one of the finest in-game leaders in the history of the game. Twistzz has taken over the team's reins after an off-season rebuild that saw Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller, Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros and head coach Wilton ""zews"" Prado depart the squad. This will be Twistzz's first time leading a team, and many in the scene have expressed concern about how the role will impact a player who remains at the peak of his powers. The 24-year-old has appeared in five of the last six HLTV Top 20 rankings, and he averaged an impressive 1.22 rating during a frustrating season for Liquid. mithR admitted that he, too, had some reservations at first about Twistzz's decision to become the IGL, but he is now amazed at how natural the role seems to feel for the Canadian. ""When I first heard he was going to be ingame leader, I was actually a bit nervous and wasn’t sure this was the right choice,"" mithR told HLTV. ""I had seen before people who thought they wanted to be in-game leader, but then they had to show up prepared every time for practice or official, so they have the full responsibility. It is very cool in the beginning, but not much fun when it becomes your everyday. ""After having worked three weeks with Twistzz, my impression right now is that he has the potential to become one of the biggest and best in-game leaders we’ve ever seen. My reason is that his calling is very clear and he has a great ability to learn from mistakes, understand what to do better and receive input, filter it, and match it to his vision of the game. ""This is not something I have experienced on this level before. And I say this as someone who has worked with a lot of in-game leaders in my career."" Liquid's signing of Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak as the new AWPer is widely regarded as a big gamble. The Polish player has never competed at the highest level, with the upcoming BLAST Premier Fall Groups being only his second LAN event on record. mithR understands the skepticism around ultimate but argues that Twistzz did ""a really great scouting job"" to find the Polish player. ""It is not a coincidence the choice fell on him,"" he noted. ""When I talked to Twistzz about how he had seen ultimate's demos and why he decided it should be him, I had no reason not to believe him. ""When I saw his demos, my impression was of course very positive. His mechanical level is very high. Time will tell if he is ready for tier 1 — it is something different. I absolutely think he is going to be challenged in a way he is not used to. ""There are some tendencies and habits in tier 1 you can’t get away with the same way you can in tier 2. But from what I have seen the last two/three weeks in practice, he has convinced me and the team that he has got what is needed."" Liquid have been placed in Group D of the BLAST Premier Fall Groups, along with Natus Vincere, BIG and Virtus.pro. Wednesday's series against the Russian side will be Justin ""jks"" Savage's first competitive match in almost ten months, and mithR admitted that the Australian is still trying to rediscover his best form. ""The first two weeks, there was quite a big development in his level,"" mithR said. ""He has gotten some roles that are new for him, and it has been some time since he last played at the highest level on a team level. ""It's nice that he kept up his level and is very familiar with CS2 by playing a lot of FACEIT. But playing on a team is different. From what I have seen and the development I’ve seen, the last two weeks have been really positive.""",28-7-2024 22:30,1722198600000

Replacing the Russian AWPer against Complexity will be the team's head coach, Eetu ""sAw"" Saha. It is unclear at this point if degster can travel to Copenhagen in time for HEROIC's remaining matches. On X, the organization said only that sAw ""will be subbing in for the time being."" ""I feel really sorry for my teammates, but this is not something that we can control,"" degster wrote on X. ""It feels really bad to miss the first game after the break when we were working really hard for that."" This is not the first time that degster has been forced to miss LAN matches for HEROIC because of travel issues. In May, he was ruled out of IEM Dallas after being denied a visa, with then-benched player Nico ""nicoodoz"" Tamjidi filling in for him. The Danish AWPer was recently transferred to Gaimin Gladiators, leaving sAw as the team's only available substitute. The BLAST Premier Fall Groups is HEROIC's first post-break tournament. The international team ended the season with a group-stage exit at YaLLa Compass after losing to Astralis, Ninjas in Pyjamas and The MongolZ. HEROIC will take on Complexity with the following lineup: René ""TeSeS"" Madsen Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck Guy ""NertZ"" Iluz Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski Eetu ""sAw"" Saha (stand-in)",29-7-2024 12:05,1722247500000
EspiranTo returns in 9INE Academy,https://www.hltv.org/news/39471/espiranto-returns-in-9ine-academy,"The Lithuanian has finally found a team after announcing his return to activity. Former Imperial and CR4ZY member Rokas ""EspiranTo"" Milasauskas has linked up with 9INE Academy, the Swedish organization has announced. The Lithuanian is one of three academy players unveiled today by 9INE, along with Roman ""n0te"" Hamze and Tom ""skyye"" Hagedorn. In February, EspiranTo announced his return to activity after taking a long break to finish his military service. In an interview with HLTV, he admitted to struggling with motivation and disciplinary issues early in his career and noted that the only thing holding him ""was pure talent."" The 23-year-old recently competed in two local tournaments, the InfoShow LAN Party and the Comic Con Baltics 2024 Finals, for a mix team called EZ4ENCE. In June, he played for 9INE Academy in the European Pro League Season 18: Division 2 and United21 Season 16. ""Just finished a bootcamp with the guys and flying home today,"" EspiranTo wrote on X. ""Extremely professional environment and a great place to start competing again."" skyye joins 9INE Academy on loan from BIG. The German player spent the last five months competing for ALTERNATE aTTaX, averaging a 0.95 rating. n0te had been without a team since May, when he left Monte Gen. 9INE Academy are now: Arnas ""Sterzig"" Kavoliunas Milan ""hypex"" Polowiec Rokas ""EspiranTo"" Milasauskas Tom ""skyye"" Hagedorn Roman ""n0te"" Hamze Patryk ""ponczek"" Wites (coach)",29-7-2024 13:10,1722251400000
degster-less HEROIC stun Complexity at BLAST,https://www.hltv.org/news/39473/degster-less-heroic-stun-complexity-at-blast,"It was yet another frustrating afternoon for the North American team, which is now staring elimination in the face. Complexity have dropped down to Group A's lower bracket at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups after a 0-2 defeat to a HEROIC team missing AWPer Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov. It's another massive blow for the North American side, which has looked sluggish and lackluster since the player break. The lack of energy was all too evident, and one has to wonder what can be done to stop the bleeding, especially after Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski vented his frustration at seeing his team repeat the same mistakes over and over again. That same sentiment was aired by Tiaan ""T.c"" Coertzen today. ""It's basic things that are costing us,"" he said in a post-match interview. HEROIC move on to the upper final to set up a clash with Spirit. It's unclear if degster will be available for the series, with the Norwegian organization expected to provide an update on the AWPer's availability soon. The absence of degster due to travel issues definitely left a potentially difficult gap to fill, but HEROIC didn't even need the AWP to shut down their opponents. They picked up six rounds on the offense thanks to a blistering 5-0 start and then put the game to bed with a flawless 7-0 run as CTs. Complexity's fans were hoping for an improved performance on Vertigo, given the team's flawless record on the map in the last three months, but the team struggled immensely on the T side and ended the first half with only four rounds to its name. Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli came to Complexity's rescue with several rifle multi-kills in the second half, with the North American team hitting map point at 12-10. But they failed to deliver the finishing blow as HEROIC equalized the score with two late rounds and maintained their momentum in overtime.",29-7-2024 16:36,1722263760000

SINNERS have announced the permanent additions of Josef ""MoriiSko"" Maurenc and Michal ""majky"" Švancara to their Counter-Strike roster, marking the end of their trial periods. majky was promoted from the Czech organization's academy team in May as a replacement for Adam ""NEOFRAG"" Zouhar, who was benched over differences in the team's vision after just five months. MoriiSko also began playing with SINNERS later that month, first as a stand-in before he officially replaced Filip ""AJTT"" Dolenský on the roster in June. The changes have yet to make an impact on the results of the Czech side, which has resided well outside of the top 30 throughout 2024 so far. Their best result with the new lineup is a narrow miss in the ESL Pro League S20 Europe closed qualifier, where SINNERS finished runners-up to 3DMAX and failed to qualify for the Maltese competition. They are currently competing in ESL Challenger League Season 48, where they have already suffered two losses in the round robin group stage, and have now begun their campaign in YaLLa Compass Summer 2024 Contenders with a win over Alliance.

Vitality edge past new-look GamerLegion in BLAST Groups opener,https://www.hltv.org/news/39475/vitality-edge-past-new-look-gamerlegion-in-blast-groups-opener,"Spinx's heroic performance on Mirage got Vitality over the line. Vitality have avoided an early upset at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups 2024 by edging past the new-look GamerLegion squad in a three-map series (Anubis 10-13, Mirage 19-17, Dust 2 13-5). Vitality will now face off against the winner of Astralis vs. Falcons for a Group A final spot, while GamerLegion will fight the loser of that match for their tournament lives. The performance won't do much to lift Vitality's spirits, however, as the European combine continues its lackluster form in recent months. They had a trophy-less 2024 so far and were eliminated in the quarter-final at the Esports World Cup after the summer break, and a hard-fought victory against the new GamerLegion, where they were one round away from losing 0-2, is far from a positive note. On the other side of the server, GamerLegion should be happy with their debut performance with the new roster. Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson showed impressive calling and more importantly fragging in the series, with their young core all having standout moments. Sebastian ""volt"" Maloș echoed the sentiment in his post-match interview despite a heartbreaking loss. ""We've gotten to a point where with this roster we can do something. It's a long-term project, everyone is super young and everyone is really hungry to win. With the right work, the sky is the limit,"" he said. While Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire and company were able to stabilize on the Dust2 decider and put together a dominant victory, the first two maps were far from smooth sailing. Their Anubis campaign was marred by a lackluster CT side and a lack of fragging bar Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's 22 kills. The tables turned on the second map, where Vitality edged out a victory in double overtime despite ZywOo being a near non-factor, with Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi picking up the slack with a 1.59-rated performance. The decider of Dust2 was simply the ZywOo show, as the French superstar put his previous map behind him and starred with a 2.27 rating to get his team over the line.",29-7-2024 20:25,1722277500000

The first day at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups came to a close with Astralis locking in a comfortable victory over Falcons in Group B (Dust2 13-7, Ancient 13-9). Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and company will next face off against Vitality in the group's upper final in a match that will secure the victor two chances to qualify for the Fall Final, while Falcons fall to the elimination match against GamerLegion. It was the two teams' first time out on the server since Astralis placed 5th-6th at the BLAST Premier Spring Final and Falcons finished runners-up at ESL Challenger Jönköping some six weeks ago. Astralis reigned supreme in their debut in the new season. They maintained control of Dust2 from start to finish, putting on an aggressive CT side up against a Falcons team struggling to find answers to the stifling style. Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's team found a brief respite once sides switched, until Astralis caught them off with a couple of B executes as device found a crucial quad-kill in a 2v4 to help end it at a comfortable 13-7 score. A more competitive first half of Ancient followed. Falcons seized momentum at first on the defense once they had guns in hand, but they were stopped in their tracks by device and Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard, who clutched consecutive 1v2s to end the half at even keel. jabbi went on to dominate around Middle once on the defense, finding openings and multi-kills galore as Falcons' approaches for control over the highly-contested area failed time and time again.

"zews interview: Liquid's issues, cadiaN's leadership, and future",https://www.hltv.org/news/39463/zews-interview-liquids-issues-cadians-leadership-and-future,"The Brazilian coach sat down with HLTV for a long interview about his rollercoaster of a Liquid stint and what he hopes to do next. Liquid's 2024 season began with high expectations after a slew of blockbuster moves but it crashed and burned early in one of the biggest flops in recent years. Seven months on, the team has already moved on from Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros, Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller and head coach Wilton ""zews"" Prado. Another rebuild has been made, and Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken is taking the team's reins for the first time in his career as he hopes to steer the ship back on course. In an interview with HLTV, zews recalled ""a very big fight"" around the end of January. That was when the problems began to take hold. ""From then on I could see it unfold,"" he said. ""So it didn't happen overnight, it was something that snowballed, let's put it that way. And it's not like things changed completely, but we began to see a clash of ideas, playing styles and personalities."" The Brazilian confirmed the public notion that the team didn't fully buy into cadiaN's system and that the Danish IGL struggled to adapt to a new style. Still, he refused to lay all the blame on cadiaN. ""It wasn't just because of one person that it failed. It was a systemic thing where we couldn't make this incompatibility compatible, so to speak."" zews is keeping his options open, though coaching doesn't seem to be high on his list of priorities. Asked what he would like to do next, he said that he would entertain a General Manager role — which would give him the sort of freedom he lacked at Liquid — and broadcast opportunities. ""In the meantime, I'll keep doing my thing here and trying to contribute the best way I can."" I first wanted to ask how you would describe your time at Liquid and what goals were set when you joined the organization at the end of last year? If I were to describe my time at Liquid in a few words, it would be...  Short and disappointing. I guess those are the words I'd use. The goals were, in the first season, obviously, to make the Major. That was the most important one and it hurt us a lot. But in the grand scheme of things, my role with Liquid was about establishing the team long-term. So we were going to chase ranking points to get invites, since we were starting from scratch. Because it's chaos, right? The scheduling and traveling... When you have to play these open qualifiers, especially with our team being from “North America” and traveling between regions… We wanted, of course, to qualify for the Major, but the most important thing was to establish ourselves as a top 16 or top 10 team that could be directly qualified for events. So, with Liquid, I had a bigger vision of where we wanted to go, but the immediate focus was on making this line-up work and positioning ourselves in the rankings. I'd also like to ask you a little about how the team was put together. When you joined the team, the signings hadn't yet been made. How did the team come about? Who was involved in the process and what was your role, in particular, in putting the team together? General Manager Jokasteve sent me a message asking if I was doing anything. He told me about reformulating the project and at first it was something completely different… It would be with oSee, Brehze and a full NA lineup - but there was the possibility of making an alternate blockbuster roster that he had been working on. cadiaN, twistzz, YEKINDAR and NAF but instead of skullz, it would be KSCERATO. He wanted me to try and help bring him in, which we ultimately couldn't do because he didn't really want to leave FURIA at the time, right? He wanted to stay there and build. It was very important for Liquid to keep that NA spot and in terms of availability, there weren't that many players on the market at the time that could do that, play up to the level of the other four players and that would get the team to sign up as we were on a deadline to make it happen or it would all fall apart. So I had to come up with a good alternative to make it happen... But when it came to defining the pieces, Twistzz, cadiaN and eventually skullz, who essentially made that decision? Was it your move? No, it was a consensus. Joka had already basically put it all together and I wouldn't have been able to have that sort of power despite what everyone thinks. But it was a consensus as everyone believed in the team's potential. There was a lot of talking, especially with cadiaN and Twistzz. At the time, Twistzz was a very valuable and important piece for Liquid and we were uncertain if he would be joining. With cadiaN, it was more or less certain that he would come. So for Twistzz… He was really keen to come to Liquid at the time, then FaZe started having great results and he needed to decide where to go. And Twistzz really liked skullz's game. And he said, 'If this kid comes, I'll join the team.' So we sped up the discussions with him. skullz was a guarantee that we'd get Twistzz, me, cadiaN, and that the lineup would be locked in. Can you explain a little bit more about your role in managing the team? When it comes to setting up the team, I didn't have that much power, and the work had already been done by Joka, so credit to him for pulling that off. But in terms of managing the team after it was assembled, I can’t hide from my responsibilities. I had management power, but things were decided by a committee at Liquid, and I think that's one of the problems that we had. There wasn't one voice, and it wasn't my voice, Joka's or Performance Manager Edward's. Everything was decided by a committee, and from my experience, leading by a committee doesn't work. You have to take all the input and feedback and make appropriate decisions but you have to follow a specific line of thinking, you can't go and try to please everyone. There has to be a voice of command, essentially, right? Exactly. That was necessary and nobody had that power. I tried at times, but it wasn't possible. There was a lot of talk about those team-building activities you did at the end of the year, even before you started competing. They gave the impression that everyone got on well, that you were building a good atmosphere. In your opinion, when did you start to feel the first problems in the team? I think the only bad thing about those activities was that we did content around them.  Personally, I think they were really cool, I thought the atmosphere on the team at the start was really good. It's really hard to pinpoint when it all changed. I think there was a very big fight within the team that I remember, around the end of January or February. And from then on I could see it unfold. So it didn't happen overnight, it was something that snowballed, let's put it that way. And it's not like things changed completely, but we began to see a clash of ideas, playing styles and personalities. Given the signs that were already there within the team, was the fact that you didn't qualify for the Major a surprise or did you almost fear that it might happen? It was certainly a surprise, but not in the sense that we didn't know it was possible. But we also knew that we could qualify and the scrims had gone well. I think that a bit of the pressure and expectation we had led to this, along with key decisions in games… And the format as well, no? Unfortunately, it was terrible, it cost us, but it was the format we had and we had to qualify regardless, right? So I think it was more because we weren't prepared or ready yet and we weren't a real team in terms of unity, let's put it that way, in terms of the mentality of knowing how to play together. And how was the leadership and the way of approaching the game managed? Because it does seem like that there were many voices within the team and that it wasn't possible to reach a compromise of how the team should play on the server. At the start of the team, I did everything I could to put cadiaN as the leader and captain, so that everyone could follow the calls and his ideology and really embrace his leadership. So I think… throughout these problems and these disagreements and incompatibilities, it started to change. There was an attempt to adapt to a style where there was more than one way for us to make rotations and play the game. Because as much as there was a leadership style, there was a bit of, let's say, difficulty in how this leadership was received by the team. This leadership was gradually lost halfway in, partially due to some of cadiaN's own decisions and partially due to some harsh resistance and opposition put up by some players. Then the big problem we had was how to restructure the leadership moving forward. cadiaN would keep calling, but we would have our own style with everyone's ideas and inputs. And that's where I think this gap of incompatibility and disagreement grew. Because we saw that the ideas for how we wanted to play and even the roles we wanted to have in the game were very different. Since the players left the team there has been a lot of talk about the incompatibilities within the team, specifically about how some players in the team might not have believed in cadiaN's system, where, like on HEROIC, he was commanding the troops all the time and the players fully trusted him. And there has also been talk of cadiaN maybe not being able to adapt to the needs of the team and the way the players wanted to play. Is that really how it was? It was more or less like this. Of course, it's never black and white. I think we got some good things from cadiaN's system. The difference is that he had always played with players who would follow him blindly but that didn't have that much experience or skill at the beginning. And Liquid's players had already won a lot, which, yes, creates difficulty in how you receive certain things but also brings a lot of experience. They are players who are capable of making their own decisions, and we would force some situations with this blind trust that later, when we reviewed the games and we saw the scores, we saw that not only was it not the best decision, but it wasn't how we wanted to play. So yes, there was very strong opposition from players, but there was also difficulty from cadiaN to adapt to this new style. It wasn't just because of one person that it failed. It was a systemic thing where we couldn't make this incompatibility compatible, so to speak. Looking back, do you think it was just a matter of cadiaN being the wrong leader for the team? To put it shortly, yes, but not because of incompetence or anything like that. I think he's a real captain, I think he's a leader above all, which is very important. He has that leadership profile and he requires the players to trust him. So I think he was not the right leader for this team for these reasons. I also came to this conclusion later on and was on board with the decision, so I was part of the process of thinking that cadiaN would not be the right leader for this team, but I don't think it's just because of him, but rather because I didn’t see a future where they would be working well together and thus were the wrong fit. I wanted to ask you about skullz, someone a lot of people associated with you. Because he's also Brazilian and he didn't have that much tier-one experience, he always seemed to be your gamble. Why do you think it didn't work out and he was unable to show what many expected? I think skullz's association with me is kind of logical, right? Part of my duties was to bring in that fifth player who wouldn't be from Europe to help with the spots. Even though, as I said, it wasn't just me, it would be unfair not to take responsibility. What failed in his case? Hard to say, a little bit of homesickness was part of it, because it was a different experience for him. It was his first international experience. He's fluent in English, but there's a difference between speaking in English and having to communicate in milliseconds. So that hurt a bit in the beginning, just like the pre-season retreat and the fact that people were speculating on his buyout and there was already some pressure because of it. And also the fact that the team already had renowned players, who can teach you, but at the same time, they can criticize you, right? Getting feedback from your idols is a tricky thing… And in the beginning, I think he was criticized a lot internally. He was our scapegoat from the start. So, from the start, it made things difficult for him. And he was the one who had the hardest job, right? He was our youngest player and had to play positions and learn some slightly different roles to be a more complete player, so I feel he didn't show his true potential. He's very good, and I believe that in FURIA, communicating in his native language and now with this experience, he's going to play better. I believe that if you ask him, he'll say that on Liquid he only had a few moments where he showed that he knew what he was doing. In general, he suffered a lot there emotionally and mentally, and even in terms of the system and role within the game, which I recognize we didn't put him in the best position to succeed. How do you think that he will fare at FURIA? With him being a Brazilian player coming from Liquid, I think he will bring some new things that he saw. I think he'll play much more loosely, much more comfortably, and the atmosphere will be much better in terms of making him feel at home and not isolated. I was there with him, but I'm 36 and his coach, right? There’s only so much I can do to make him feel comfortable. We live different lives, so the best I could do is support him and be there with him. I think he will do well at FURIA and I hope to see him keep growing and show what he’s capable of. Speaking about your departure from Liquid, how was this whole process managed? Did you discuss the possibility of staying with the team? Was it your decision or a mutual one? The last few months of Liquid were really complicated because there was a lot of uncertainty about what would happen. We had unhappy players and different scenarios were being considered. To be honest, I didn't think I was going to leave until I got to Brazil and had a chat with Joka. Everything changed. I had even been under the impression that it was guaranteed that I wouldn't leave now, that we would restructure things, that there was still time to get things in order. So it wasn't my decision. But I admit that I was very unhappy towards the end. I had sacrificed my health a lot, and we weren’t bringing in the results we wanted. I always believed that, for a team to be a champion or consistently good, everyone must want to be there, which wasn't the case for us. So this led to a lot of unhappiness within the team, on my part and on the part of some of the other players there. So it wasn't a mutual decision, I don't think anyone wanted it in the end, nor did they know how it would turn out. So much so that I received messages from the players, like, 'I thought you were doing well, we were doing well, I don't know what happened.' But Liquid had to make a difficult decision and that was the result in the end, right? That's life. What sort of demands would you have made if you were to stay? I wouldn't be making demands to stay because I love Liquid. As much as it was a sad experience in the end, we had great moments, the players like the people there, I think they're good human beings. So I wouldn't have made demands to stay but I would have made recommendations. I believe a team needs to have players who want to be there. That would have been my first recommendation. The second one: if there wasn't a leadership, we needed to establish one. We needed a voice everyone would listen to, follow and believe in. For me, that was one of the main points. But for me, the most important aspect was to get some things right: the culture we had within the team, the team mentality and the way people interacted with each other, because a lot of stuff was being handled behind the scenes instead of being addressed directly or even telling the person at times that there was discontentment so they could fix it. We had high standards to keep and live up to, but they were internalized and sometimes not even known. The player next to you was never asked to maintain those high standards. And I think those would be the main points to change for next season, in terms of the culture of the team, so that it could move towards being a really top-tier competitive team. Were you surprised by Twistzz's decision to be an IGL? Do you think he will succeed in the role? To give credit to Twistzz, I think he has a lot of in-game knowledge. Towards the end of our Liquid tenure, I would say that 90 to 95% of our tactics, our playbook, and playing methodology were being created by Twistzz and YEKINDAR already. It had already gone from cadiaN by the end as we knew a move was going to happen, and Twistzz proved to be very capable. But at the same time, being a leader and an IGL is about much more than having a playbook and in-game knowledge. It's about leadership, how you treat your teammates, how you get the best out of them, how you deliver them the bad news to hold them to those high standards. So I believe he has a lot of work to do and to prove himself in terms of leading men. But in terms of his ability as a captain and strategist... He's got that in spades, and he probably is, in my opinion, one of the top five players in the world with the most knowledge. Now he just needs to learn the human side and the leadership side. You said just before that one of Liquid's main goals during the initial stage was to consolidate the team in the top 16 or top 10. The fact is that, when the changes happened, the team was ranked 11th in the world. Do you think there was a possibility that the team wouldn't go through so many changes? Perhaps changing just one player and keeping the other four and the coach? That was one of the options, yes. Let's talk about the goals first.  I believe that the goal we set ourselves was about being a top 10 team by the end of the year. So I think the way the results came out hurt more than the goals we had set as we tried not to create too high of expectations. We didn't qualify for the Major, which definitely hurt as it was another one of our goals, and went through many qualifiers, but in the end, we got enough points that we didn't need to travel to those qualifiers anymore. So, in terms of these objectives, it was disappointing because I believe that what was externalized as the team's objectives did not match the real internal expectations. Obviously, we had a much higher standard than what people talked about. But moving forward, there was a chance only one piece would change. We knew cadiaN wouldn't continue, so I advised him to find a new place that made more sense to him. I told him, 'I believe you are a true leader and a good one. You are a good player, but you need to find a different team. Find a place that makes more sense to you and that will listen to you.' You always have to deal with things head-on. And with skullz, there was a world where he would continue, obviously, it wasn't even that difficult, but skullz also expressed that a Brazilian team would make more sense to him so we were already in talks with FURIA to see if it could make sense. When the team was built, it made a lot of sense, but moving forward, he wouldn't have the same impact or happiness there if he wasn’t fully bought in and bought into it. This I think matters a lot. In my view, it would take two changes, and not three, to really give us the boost we needed, after eight months of experience where you could see the areas we needed to improve and what we were lacking as a team. I was just watching a video by Mauisnake, and he was rating the changes that teams had made over the past six months. One of his biggest criticisms regarding Liquid is that he felt you were behind when it comes to the meta. How do you think you did from a tactical standpoint? Did you feel as prepared during the final stages of your Liquid tenure as you had during the peak of your career, when you won the two Majors? No, obviously not. When we won the two Majors we were at the top of the meta, we were the ones setting it, but at no point did I not feel like I couldn't do it. In my view, CS evolves in terms of tactics and the meta, of course,  but the fundamental aspects about how to play as a team, how to communicate, how to make people play off each other, react… etc. Those things haven't changed that much and shouldn’t ever change at their core. So I felt qualified to do that. But when I joined Liquid, I was asked to be more of a person to manage the team and the goals and not focus so much on the tactical part as the players there were more than capable of it. In the beginning, I really enjoyed getting to know the meta to see what was changing and helping in other areas in terms of preparing for matches. We got to a point where I was printing out like 130 sheets of paper for each game, so we were already over-prepared and even had too much, in my opinion. It was more about filtering the right information, we didn't need more analysis, it was an area that was already well covered. Liquid's players liked to do this individual preparation work themselves, which is amazing as you will never be as prepared if someone else is doing your “homework” for you. So it didn't require me to do it for them, it was more about organizing ideas together and making sure we were on the same page, with the same vision of how we wanted to react to these plays and knowing which plays to expect. Or at least that’s what it should’ve been… Looking back, do you have any regrets about your time at Liquid? Would you have done anything differently? It's like people say in English, 'Hindsight is 20-20.' I would certainly do things differently, but at the time, I did them because they seemed right in terms of dealing with the situations that were happening. But I'd definitely do things differently. I'd be tougher on some players. Even though I didn't have the power, I'd take the liberty of saying, 'No, it shouldn't be this way.' Or, 'Yes, let's just trust this person and do it this way.' But I have no regrets. It was an experience that… Man, I'm passionate about CS, I'm passionate about the game. I love Liquid, I love our scene and the esports industry. So it was really cool to be a part of it all again. I regret that it was short-lived and we didn't succeed, because I know that, at the end of the day, if my job was to manage this team and make this group of people functional, despite the problems we had, it was my responsibility to find a way to make these pieces work. I didn't manage to do it, so my regret is that I didn't succeed in the job, despite the factors we had against us. What is your opinion about this new Liquid squad? To tell you the truth, I don't know much about ultimate. jks is more experienced than skullz, but from everything I've heard, their personality profiles are similar. So he will be a more passive and quiet guy. It will depend a lot on how the team will fit together under Twistzz's leadership. I think they can have a good future, but if I were them, I would set more realistic expectations, as it will be a learning process and there will be difficulties at the start. But if they keep the pieces fit together and they work on the issues that will crop up, I think they can do well. One of the biggest concerns is the impact that the leadership role will have on Twistzz's game. You said that most of the calls were being created by Twistzz and YEKINDAR during the final tournaments of the season, and Twistzz kept doing very well. Do you think that his game won't suffer? As I said, one thing is adapting your playbook and setting how you like to play, before a match or during practice. Another thing is being responsible during the whole game for making those calls, making reads, keeping the team organized and following the calls, even when they're not the right move, keeping everyone aligned and working on mistakes. Because it's not just about games, right? Perhaps there will be an impact, I think that's the most natural thing. Twistzz is one of the most mechanically gifted players I have seen. So I think he might be one of the rare cases of players who don't suffer as much because if he puts himself in positions where he's not always in the middle of the action, having to look at the radar, and he has to worry more about leading the team in late round situations, I think he won't suffer as much. But if he is placed in a situation where he has to do too much, where he has to read the game, make calls and frag, then it will be hard to keep up the numbers because… Any human being has to specialize in one area, right? You can't be a jack of all trades. After it was announced that you were leaving Liquid, there was some speculation that you might be joining FURIA. Was that ever a possibility? Did you ever think about it? I would be crazy if I said I never thought about it… they are a powerhouse in many ways, especially in Brazil and in what they mean to the region. And, in my opinion, they just got even better now with skullz. But to your question, no… I don’t think it was ever a real possibility. They never started a conversation about it and truthfully I didn’t expect them to either. Even if they had, I'm not sure we would’ve come to an agreement as there is a lot of history there directly and indirectly since the MIBR / FURIA days… Please don’t get me wrong, I know some of these guys very well and this is not meant to be made bigger than it is or to try and make a knock on them. I just believe they are an organization that has their way of doing things and that they have a strong belief in that way. I too have been around long enough to know what's what and have a strong conviction on my beliefs and ways of how things should be done. Have you thought about what you're going to do? Are you open to doing something different in the industry? I wasn’t involved in anything coaching or esports competitive for almost two and a half years after EG… A lot of people think I was coaching here in Brazil, but no… I was already doing something very different from what I was used to by being away from competition, which had been the main priority in my life for about as long as I can remember in recent memory. I was doing my best to take some time to figure things out and put extra focus on getting my life and health in order - especially after the heart attack. I then had a glimpse back into how much I missed all of this with those two weeks helping out O PLANO. They were in a messed up situation and wanted help and in the end, they were the ones who helped me… Then almost immediately I went to Fluxo, where we qualified for the Major and then I joined Liquid. Those were cool experiences where, even if not pretty - we achieved some goals, but towards the end, I remembered some of the hardships and letdowns that had made me want to leave in the first place. I sacrificed a lot of my health to do these years of coaching. My health isn't the same anymore but I put up with it because I want to. As I’ve always said, I love competing, I love esports and it’s the choice I choose to do willingly. But… it’s not getting any easier to make that choice. Purely as a coach, if something comes up that makes sense, I will always consider it. But it’s hard as I don’t feel coaches nowadays have the power to do what needs to be done. It’s different when your trajectory has built up to that power and that’s what I believed I would have at Liquid. It’s kind of like an ex-girlfriend you dated for three years… if you break up and get back together after a while, is it a new relationship or a continuation of the old one? I believed it would be the latter… All of this to say that I would really love to continue in this industry as I genuinely do love it despite its flaws and hope to continue being an active part of contributing towards a better path. What would I do if not coaching? I think I have two options that I could very much see making a lot of sense. I would love to officially go down the path of GM where I can really put a project together from beginning to end. You know, do things the way I believe they should be done, where you make moves that make sense and create a sustainable long-term project. That kind of vision is lacking, in my opinion, and I am one of the people who have the experience, relationships and skills for it as I have done similarly in the past. Or, on the other hand, I would love to be involved in building this spectacle, which means being part of broadcasts as a member of talent. I think I could do really well in trying to share some of my experience and break down some of the more nuanced details that are sometimes overlooked in an entertaining way. Thankfully, I have always had very good friends in this industry. So, bringing some insight into them and a bit of this more realistic view of what it means to compete at a high level could be interesting. But again, it’s more about how to complement the show. So in not so short form, my future is open and I am still analysing. I have to see everything that comes my way, I have some interesting offers on the table. But now is the time to slow things down and then make the right decision. I am 36 years old, I have a lot of experience, and I have gone through a lot of good and bad things. And it's time to put those things into practice somewhere that will keep me in the business and where things can be done in an objective and effective way to bring me a little peace too, right? I deserve to be happy too and all those who work In our business know how difficult it is to maintain this balance between health, personal life and work. I would love to find something that allows me to obsess over my work but also be able to see the people around me that I love more than three times a year. Have you already had talks with TOs about doing this broadcast work? I've had a few conversations with friends in the industry, with casters, analysts, and other people I thought it made sense to talk to. I've sent messages to some of the tournament organizers, but I haven't had much of a response yet. I know the tournament calendar is set, so if it happens, it'll happen when it needs to. But in the meantime, I'll keep doing my thing here and trying to contribute the best way I can.",29-7-2024 22:48,1722286080000
Short news: Week 30,https://www.hltv.org/news/39437/short-news-week-30,"In an interview with Pley.gg, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken gave his opinion about why the previous Liquid roster didn't live up to expectations. ""There was a lack of work ethic in the team,"" he said. ""It was just not working inside or outside of the game. There was no chemistry or synergy. And you can’t really play the game without those two things."" Questioned about Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller's leadership, Twistzz seemingly took a jab at his former teammate. ""It was very different from what I had experienced before in FaZe. In some way, it made me value karrigan a lot more. And that’s all I have to say about that,"" he said, praising cadiaN, however, for his momentum calls. In a statement issued by the Esportal Group AB, it was revealed that Peter Eriksson, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, determined that Esportal and Inferno Online will continue to operate as normal at least until August 24.

""For all customers, this means that Inferno Online's gates will remain open as usual and that it is still possible to use their purchased game time,"" the statement read. ""On the Esportal.com platform, the servers will also remain open, and most planned activities will continue without interruption.""

At BLAST, we had the one map against FaZe where we played really well and after that, we didn't show our level. My goal is to show we can compete against anyone, even if it's against NAVI or Spirit.

Spirit have secured a spot in the BLAST Premier Fall Groups's Group A upper bracket final with a 2-0 victory over HEROIC. HEROIC once again had to play with their coach Eetu ""sAw"" Saha as Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov still couldn't fly to Copenhagen. On the opening day they upset Complexity with the Finn in their starting five. This time around HEROIC failed to progress through the upper bracket, although they did still surprise by taking Spirit to the brink on Vertigo. Boris ""magixx"" Vorobiev needed to clutch a 1vs2 situation in the final round of regulation to get his team over the line. A brilliant start on the CT side of their Anubis pick cleared the path for Spirit, as they even took a 7-5 lead before switching to the easier T side. HEROIC ran out of fuel on the harder side, only managing to tally one round on the defense as Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets and his teammates comfortably closed out the map 13-6 to secure their spot in the group final. ""You can't deny that we would have had a better chance with degster,"" René ""TeSeS"" Madsen said after the match. ""It's annoying that we can't play with a full team, but it is what it is.

The team led by Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt began their qualifying campaign with a hard-fought victory against Marcelo ""coldzera"" David's RED Canids, which earned them a semi-final clash versus Imperial. The match was another close one and ended in overtime on the Inferno decider, but paiN made it past Santino ""try"" Rigal and company to send them down to the lower bracket. Imperial beat MIBR in the lower bracket to earn a rematch against paiN, but the latter were much more comfortable in the final and ran out 2-0 victors. The game started on Inferno, where paiN secured a 13-8 victory thanks to a stellar performance by Lucas ""lux"" Meneghini before Lucas ""nqz"" Soares and João ""snow"" Vinicius took over the mantle on Anubis.

Complexity send lackluster OG to Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39481/complexity-send-lackluster-og-to-showdown,"OG's losing streak extends to nine matches. Complexity have eliminated OG from the BLAST Premier Fall Groups 2024 after a three-map series (Ancient 13-11, Vertigo 9-13, Anubis 13-7). Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski and company will now meet HEROIC in the Group A Consolidation final, with the Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski-led squad hoping to be bolstered by the arrival of Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov for the series. For Complexity, the win was much tougher than expected ahead of the game. The North Americans could have easily lost the match 0-2 and have EliGE's 1.54-rated performance to thank for bailing them out. For OG, the loss marks a continuation of a dreadful run of form. Their winless streak, which features losses to Chinggis Warriors, ATOX, and Insilio, has now been extended to over three months after yet another last-place exit. The series began with EliGE powering Complexity from 3-9 to a comeback win on Ancient, with OG unable to get anything going on their defensive half. OG answered on Vertigo with a dominant T-side, where they well and truly put an end to Complexity's streak on the map with a 13-9 win, meaning the Anubis decider was required. OG got off to a hot start on the decider before Complexity employed a double-AWP setup to get themselves back into the game on the CT side. A second-half pistol put them in the driver's seat, and they never looked back on their way to a 13-7 victory.",30-7-2024 17:19,1722352740000

With Vitality still awaiting their first trophy of 2024, Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire made it clear that his priority was improving the squad's defensive halves when he spoke to BLAST at the start of Fall Groups. ""We have the best T side round win % in the first half of 2024, but on CT side we were like 12th,"" said p,7322 . ""I don't think it's about our positions, I think it's how we play our role. We lack multi-kills sometimes, converting rounds, we're not good enough on CT side."" Against Astralis, at first, those fears were averted as Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan — who is still adapting to his anchor roles — dominated Ramp on Nuke. The Israeli has a 1.22 T rating for the year so far but just 1.04 on CT, a trend that has slowed in the last month with 1.13 on CT and 1.19 on T. It was flameZ's impact on both Nuke and Dust2 that made the difference with twin 1v2s: The first on round four on Nuke and the second at 12-11 on Dust2 to confirm the win. Vitality, as they have all year, looked supremely confident on T side, after they lost the Dust2 pistol but marched to 7 T rounds regardless. That spell included a stylish 'FURIA walk' up Catwalk all the way round to A site that caught Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz completely off-guard. One concern for Vitality despite the win was Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut, who shied away from the AWP again en route to a quiet 1.06 series rating. 2023's No. 1 player also has flameZ to thank for flipping the narrative away from a whiff that allowed Alexander ""br0"" Bro to clutch a 1v2 of his own late on map two. Ultimately, however, there was no harm done and Vitality are one series from Copenhagen's Fall Final. ""We did so well at the start of rounds, getting the advantage,"" analysed apEX post-game. ""And then, always someone fucked up the round. It was always someone different, the last round it was me, it was bad in that way. We have to step up for that. As I told you yesterday CT is the issue right now, and we need to win these rounds."" Astralis, who only truly looked like themselves in the second half of Dust2, now await the result of Falcons against GamerLegion to discover their opponent in the lower bracket.",30-7-2024 19:43,1722361380000
Perseverance release team after ESL ban*,https://www.hltv.org/news/39483/perseverance-release-team-after-esl-ban,"The NA team was disqualified from ESL Challenger League after submitting ""false evidence to mislead the tournament administration."" Perseverance have released their team in the wake of a ruling that banned the roster from all ESL Pro Tour competition for two months. An ESL statement read: ""Last week, it came to our attention that Perseverance Gaming submitted false evidence to mislead the tournament administration in an effort to have an ESL Challenger League match rescheduled. ""Following a thorough investigation into this violation, we have decided to disqualify the team from ESL Challenger League Season 48. Additionally, we are suspending the team and its players from all EFG pro competitions for two months."" In addition to their disqualification from ECL, the two-month ban means that Perseverance's roster will be barred from qualifiers for IEM Rio, ESL Challenger Atlanta, and ESL Challenger Katowice. The organization condemned the actions of its team swiftly, saying that they were ""lost for words"" and calling the situation ""a complete failure of trust and integrity."" Four of the team's members, streamer Collin ""CoJoMo"" Moren alongside Cory ""shutout"" Frymark, Gabriel ""Gabe"" Shah, and John ""mds"" Marin, recently qualified to the IESF World Championship competing as Team USA, which is outside of the ESL Pro Tour. IESF has not yet confirmed if the team will be allowed to compete. July 31, 2024 10:30  Update: Dust2.us have conducted an investigation into the ban, discovering falsified text messages shown by shutout in the ESL Challenger League Discord. His message reads: ""My power company is sending me alerts about power outages tomorrow and I can show proof. Can we reschedule Mythic tomorrow ? I'm in a heavy storm zone. Do you want a screen shot of this?"" The ruse was intended to allow Perseverance to play with new player Nelvin ""nooz"" Gonzalez instead of Chance ""xaler"" Palmer against Mythic on July 18. Dust2.us' report also indicates that a text from shutout's supposed power company actually came from Gabe's personal number. Weather forecasts around shutout's location also showed that, from July 17 to July 18, there was a maximum of 0.73 inches of rain while wind speeds only hit 13 miles per hour — not conditions expected to cause a power outage.

As their reward Falcons have earned a rematch against Astralis, the team that easily beat them in the first game of this very tournament. GamerLegion were surprisingly competitive against Vitality in their debut with Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson in charge, their exuberant young squad showing immense firepower and potential, but it all melted away against Falcons, against whom the team suffered from slow starts on both maps. Henrich ""sl3nd"" Hevesi was the only member of their young firepower trio who shone, and they were generally outclassed by their far more experienced opposition throughout. Still, their showing overall at BLAST Groups was enough to ensure many will be excited to see more of the team. Falcons meanwhile came into this season in desperate need of better tournament placings, considering their thoroughly underwhelming first half of the year. Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen himself said in a pre-game interview with James ""BanKs"" Banks that ""something needs to happen this season, we need to provide better results."" Whilst beating this GamerLegion side is not enough for a Falcons side that invested significant money putting the squad together, the manner in which they did so was promising. Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković and Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García played like stars, Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer called a fantastic game, particularly on Nuke, and they made short work of a promising young team.

Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken has taken responsibility for Liquid's rebuild in an interview with Pley.gg, confirming he had the ""final say"" in the side's transfers. The interview came ahead of Twistzz's first event as an in-game leader at BLAST Premier Fall Groups. His transition to captain has not been greeted with universal praise, with the likes of Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović pointing out that, at 24, he is still in the prime of his career when it comes to fragging. Twistzz, however, knew it was coming: ""I feel like it was kind of inevitable for me to become an in-game leader. It was already lingering in my mind at the end of 2023 but I didn't expect it to happen so soon ... If I stayed at FaZe for two or three years, I probably would have become the captain at some point."" As Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller's influence waned, Twistzz's grew to the point where he was doing a ""lot of captain work"" at the end of last season, he says. ""I was already very vocal in-game as a mid-round caller, communicating a lot for others and myself. YEKINDAR and I also had a lot to do with trying to get people on the same page last season, trying to figure out the system. ""Logically it makes the most sense to have your most experienced player be the captain."" He later added, ""I think it's not the biggest change for myself."" As captain, Twistzz also had plenty of say in transfers and led the scouting process. ""At the end of the day, I did have the final say in this rebuild. ...

""Luckily, I had some help from past analysts that I've worked with in terms of scouting. One of the names I was given was ultimate.

FaZe inch past new Cloud9 in overtime,https://www.hltv.org/news/39489/faze-inch-past-new-cloud9-in-overtime,"Cloud9 put FaZe up against the ropes but failed to close out the series after the decider went to extra rounds. Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov, Kaisar ""ICY"" Faiznurov and Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko were a formidable trio as Cloud9 pursued their first victory with a new lineup, but in the end FaZe pulled a rabbit out of the hat to take the Fall Groups's Group C opener in overtime. The revamped Cloud9 looked completely lost on the attacking side of Dust2, but after rallying and nearly bringing their map pick back on the defense, they carried that momentum through the series. ICY showed his teeth on that first map, one tailored for AWPers, and ended it with a 1.50 rating as he headlined Cloud9's comeback attempt. Ax1Le then shined on the CT side of Inferno, where he kept his Pit position, as he and his teammates locked it down 8-4 before a strong attacking side gave them an ample 13-7 victory. The 22-year-old and ICY, who showed a flashy and aggressive brand of AWPing, then carried their form to Mirage, but HeavyGod couldn't find the same impact as he had on the previous maps. He did win a crucial clutch early on, though, and Cloud9 still got two match points before the end of regulation. In classic FaZe fashion when up against the ropes, Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and his men won the final two rounds on the attack to force overtime. FaZe is as FaZe does, and so they came out on top in extra rounds with a fantastic performance from David ""frozen"" Čerňanský, who shook off a poor showing on Inferno to thrive in the decider. ""We didn't have information on how they played, there's no stats,"" the Slovakian rifler said after the match. ""On Inferno I got my ass whooped, I wasn't in the zone, I wasn't calling well.

Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius has said that Natus Vincere learned a lesson from their post-Copenhagen Major struggles as they look to build on their Esports World Cup title. Natus Vincere got the new tournament season off to a rousing start after defeating FURIA, FaZe, MOUZ and G2 en route to the title in Saudi Arabia. It was only NAVI's second trophy since switching to an international setup, in the summer of 2023.

Liquid are through to the upper bracket final of Group D after securing a 2-0 victory over Virtus.pro at BLAST Premier Fall Groups, requiring triple overtime to close out Ancient (22-20) before stealing the Russian team's Dust2 pick (13-6) in dominant fashion. All eyes were on the Dutch organization as they underwent another significant overhaul during the tournament break, replacing Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller, Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros, and head coach Wilton ""zews"" Prado with Justin ""jks"" Savage, Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak, and former Apeks coach Torbjørn ""mithR"" Nyborg. The Australian rifler hadn't played an official since he was benched from G2 in October 2023, and the latter arrived on the team as a completely unknown quantity, plucked from obscurity in Europe's tier-three scene after passing the eye test of multiple players and impressing Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken. The 24-year-old Canadian took up leadership duties as a part of the overhaul, which raised questions about whether he could keep up his top-rated performances for Liquid and brought an air of uncertainty surrounding the transition. However, the team survived their first test with aplomb, moving past Virtus.pro in a series that started with a roar and ended with a gasp. The Russian side were contentious at the start of Liquid's Ancient pick, tying the score 4-4, but jks and Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis worked in tandem to power their side to an 8-4 lead on the T side and quickly reach map point in the second half, 12-7. A clutch from Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali spurred on a Virtus.pro comeback and the teams battled into overtime, but it was there that ultimate came alive. Despite a handful of opening kills, the Polish sniper had a quiet showing in regulation (11-16 K-D), but stepped up massively with a 21-10 K-D over three sets of extra rounds. He took the game into his own hands in triple OT and single-handedly set Liquid on map point before they closed out, showing signs of what the team likely saw when scouting him. A replay including the final kill can be found here. Virtus.pro ran out of steam on Dust2, a 4-1 lead dwindling rapidly as they couldn't find a way past Twistzz's secondary AWP and Keith ""NAF"" Markovic's stellar defense of B.

""A shameful game from us, that's it,"" the Lithuanian wrote on X. The series kicked off on Anubis, Liquid's map pick. Natus Vincere had won one only one of their previous three games on the map, but they gave a strong account of themselves on the offense. b1t continued his good form, racking up 15 frags as NAVI picked up an 8-4 lead - a scoreline that could have been more lopsided had Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis not pulled off a sneaky clutch in the ninth round. The complexion of the game changed after half-time as Liquid found another gear. They took the game to their opponents as they went on a dominant 8-1 record, and then held off a late comeback attempt from NAVI to lock down the map. Natus Vincere weren't shaken up by that loss and came out on Mirage looking for revenge. They dictated the pace from the early exchanges and racked up ten rounds on the offense, led by b1t, who posted a stunning 17-3 score and a 2.34 rating. The second half was a mere formality as NAVI quickly picked up three rounds, sending the series to Inferno. NAVI carried their momentum into the decider map and raced out to a commanding 7-0 lead on the T side. Liquid then finally hit their stride and enjoyed a spell of dominance, bringing the deficit down to just two rounds before the side switch.

Falcons 8-4  GamerLegion It probably should have been an even more dominant scoreline for Falcons, they started 7-0, but they will still be happy with such a strong defensive half on a T-sided map. Henrich ""sl3nd"" Hevesi and Sebastian ""volt"" Maloș's good work engendered a mini-revival in the half for their team, but GamerLegion still have plenty to do to take their map pick. Falcons 4-0  GamerLegion Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen hopped on the broadcast for a quick interview with James ""BanKs"" Banks before his team's game against GamerLegion, and he gave his thoughts on Falcons' struggles. On Falcons' performances so far: Let's be honest, last season wasn't good enough. I was hired to put Falcons on the map and also to win trophies, and the level we showed last season was not good enough. I think I saw some light at the end of the tunnel for us at ESL Jönköping. Obviously, without disrespecting any of the teams there, it's not the level we want to be, we want to be much higher, but at least I saw improvement. On Vitality also taking time to ramp up with zonic at the helm: The first nine months on Astralis weren't pretty either. Maybe it's around the system we are creating, it takes time for all the players to adapt to. I'm obviously trying my best, no one wants to suck for the first eight to nine months of the team. But I also do think that in modern Counter-Strike you can't just assemble a team and expect it to roll from the beginning, unless you have three or four of the best players in the world. We are working on it, but also something needs to happen this season, we need to provide better results. On bouncing back: ""The problem yesterday, we felt a big difference. We underestimated GamerLegion, not cheering for each other, not screaming when we won. We said today, right now, we didn't win a trophy yet, we need to fight for everything. Today we showed up."" On nearly letting Dust2 slip away: ""We did so well at the start of rounds, getting the advantage. And then, always someone fucked up the round. It was always someone different, the last round it was me, it was bad in that way. We have to step up for that. As I told you yesterday CT is the issue right now, and we need to win these rounds."" Astralis 11-13  Vitality Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut can thank Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan for the bailout, and it's another map defining 1v2 for the Israeli entry fragger. It's another map where Vitality's CT side struggles, and ZywOo, after being so good yesterday, was barely a factor. Fortunately, the riflers save the day. Astralis 11-12  Vitality Astralis 10-12  Vitality Astralis 10-11  Vitality All of this CT activity from Vitality worked so well earlier but Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz has come alive — it's now both teams playing well right at the death. From ""read like a book"" to plenty of ""putain"" from Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire. Astralis 7-11  Vitality Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz has two opening frags in a row but needed a clutch to convert the second round. Astralis' captain has decided to do it all himself. Astralis 5-10  Vitality Astralis, down 9-5, tried to unveil a new B split with Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr jumping to CT but Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan takes over the round with a Long flank. More of the same at the start of the second half. ""Read like a fucking book,"" screams Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire. Astralis 5-7  Vitality The FURIA walk from Vitality summed up the half, really, with Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire one step ahead of Astralis throughout. But Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard stands tall at the end of the half to keep the gap to just two rounds. Astralis 3-4  Vitality A jumpscare for Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz as Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire calls the perfect round for a 'FURIA walk' up Short. Astralis 3-1  Vitality Vitality have their first Dust2 round with a fast run out the Doors to catch Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard napping, with a Martin ""stavn"" Lund whiff from CT confirming the round. Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi and Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut both defined maps in yesterday's comeback win over GamerLegion but Nuke was all Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan. His 1v2 kept Vitality in the drivers seat in what would have been a tilting round to lose, and he went from strength to strength afterwards. Astralis 7-13  Vitality Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan survived his tough CT test on Ramp but Alexander ""br0"" Bro got absolutely destroyed — as did most of Astralis, to be fair. Astralis 7-12  Vitality But for how much longer? This has been a paddling, on Astralis' pick too. Vitality 8-3  Astralis A three-round T side Astralis streak has been answered by four in a row from Vitality, with the economy firmly in French control. Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan has been targeted on Ramp but looks like he's done his homework over the summer break. 12-5 K-D for now. Vitality 4-1  Astralis More stunning insight from the in-game chat. 500 upvotes on Reddit guaranteed. Vitality 4-0  Astralis Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard's lurk out Ramp earned him two easy kills on Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire and Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi, but it's the Ramp player himself Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan who flies up Vents to keep Vitality rolling. On slow starts: ""It's happening to many teams, but for us it's not an easy fix. We're trying to work on solutions, we don't know 'you do this and it's fixed.'"" On his own inconsistency: ""Overall the T-side lurker role has changed, it's definitely harder. I don't see many lurkers pop off like they used to. Jimpphat is doing really well but I don't know about anyone else. I'm working on it, the team is working on it."" An ancient permaban gives Vitality the edge over Astralis, but both teams have the map pools to compete. It wasn't particularly pretty, but Complexity got the job done against and OG side sporting a stand-in. Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski was the shining light across the whole series, he took Ancient entirely into his own hands and offered the stiffest resistance on Vertigo, but Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli and Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou stepped up on Anubis to help get things over the line. OG were surprisingly competitive, but ultimately they didn't really have enough firepower to hang. Complexity will face off against HEROIC in the lower final as they seek to continue their BLAST Fall Groups journey. OG 6-5  Complexity Six AWP kills in the last two rounds, and Complexity are back in it. OG 1-2  Complexity OG 13-9  Complexity Complexity's streak on Vertigo is well and truly over. WHile yesterday's loss to HEROIC might have been a blip, losing your home map to OG should be a sign of trouble. Anubis will decide the victory, and Complexity have already lost the map twice this season. OG 11-9  Complexity OG 9-8  Complexity A pistol round got them close, and OG have just taken the lead in the lates stages of Vertigo. Mădălin-Andrei ""MoDo"" Mirea's 1vs3 attempt proved crucial despite Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery stopping the Romanian as the last CT, as it meant Complexity's finances were never in a strong state. OG are a round ahead, and Complexity are down to an eco. OG 5-7  Complexity After their hot start, Complexity have cooled off and allowed OG back into the game. They should still close this out, though, especially if they can win the pistol. The European combine's efforts have been led by Mădălin-Andrei ""MoDo"" Mirea, who leads the way with 11 kills. OG 1-4  Complexity After a slow start to Ancient, the North Americans look to have finally hit their stride. The fragging is unsurprisingly led by Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski, but his teammates aren't far behind. OG 11-13  Complexity Complexity have done it. From 3-9 down they did just enough to take the lead in the series, as Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski took over in the late rounds to get his team over the line. OG 9-8  Complexity Michael ""Grim"" Wince and Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski are powering up, and the duo has now helped Complexity reduce the deficit to just one round. Grim had an especially nice sequence during an A-site post-plant. OG 9-6  Complexity The pistol round was a must-win for Complexity and they passed the first test, with a comfortable 3-0 conversion a nice cherry on top. They're just three rounds away now. OG 9-3  Complexity Complexity won two rounds with the help of their pistol victory, but it has been dire straits for the North Americans since then. Nils ""k1to"" Gruhne kept his team in it with an ace early on, and OG haven't looked back since, as Mădălin-Andrei ""MoDo"" Mirea and Maciej ""F1KU"" Miklas took over the action. Complexity need a hell of a T-side now. OG 4-3  Complexity The German rifler has had a rotten time of it recently and is averaging a 0.86 rating in the last three months, but the lack of in-game-leading looks to have freed him up. OG 3-2  Complexity Not much impact to see from the post-match talk Michael ""Grim"" Wince mentioned — OG lead early on despite losing the pistol. Michael ""Grim"" Wince also talked to James ""BanKs"" Banks ahead of their OG bout and was positive about his team's chances. On yesterday's loss: ""We know what to do next after that. We couldn't really close the game out. They were playing really well even though they played with a coach, so I wouldn't be too worried. We had a good talk after it. On Complexity's team spirit: ""We have a really good team environment. We're definitely not a team that just shows up to work."" On OG match: ""The pressure is definitely on us. We shouldn't underestimate them, so we need to be on our A game and gain some confidence."" René ""TeSeS"" Madsen spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks after their loss to Spirit, where they took the Russian team to the brink on Vertigo. On dropping a 9-3 lead on Vertigo: ""We agreed that we should have closed that out even though we played with sAw, and we just tried to reset after that."" On playing without degster: ""You can't deny we would have had a better chance with degster. It's annoying we can't play with a full team, but it is what it is. No matter the situation, we will try to make the most out of it."" HEROIC's next challenge will come in the consolidation final, with the European combine hoping Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov will be able to feature in the match. Spirit 13-6  HEROIC HEROIC's five-round T half did not allow for a competitive second half of Anubis as Spirit ran off to a 13-6 victory on the attack to close out their map pick and take the series 2-0. Spirit 4-4  HEROIC HEROIC are not putting their hands up just yet, and have finally found their groove on the attack to bring it to 4-4 to keep Spirit on their toes. Spirit 4-0  HEROIC Spirit are off to a great start on the CT side of Anubis, their map pick, winning the first four on the trot. They have already tallied enough rounds to make it a serviceable half as they seek to close out the series in two after taking Vertigo in the last round of regulation. Spirit 13-11  HEROIC Boris ""magixx"" Vorobiev slipped the net in a 1vs2 situation and got a free plant on B in the final round of regulation. Two peeks by Guy ""NertZ"" Iluz and Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck gave magixx the space to clutch out in the afterplant and get Spirit over the line to take a 1-0 lead in the series. Spirit 9-11  HEROIC Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets came alive at a crucial moment. As HEROIC lept ahead 11-8 and forced Spirit to buy in an all-or-nothing gamble, the young phenom downed four players to keep his side on the prowl against a financially struggling CT side. Spirit 7-9  HEROIC HEROIC got a big 9-3 lead in the first half, but their lead has been reduced to just two as Spirit won four rounds on the attack including the first gun round. Spirit 2-8  HEROIC Two quick kills by Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck running onto the B site with flashes from Eetu ""sAw"" Saha kept HEROIC on the front foot as they forced Spirit on an eco and brought their lead to 8-2. Spirit 1-2  HEROIC Spirit and HEROIC are off to the races on Vertigo, where Guy ""NertZ"" Iluz and company won the first pistol round to go up 2-0 before the Russian squad tallied their first with a buy. Spirit's Anubis pick will follow and, if necessary, the series will end on a Mirage decider. Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov, who had to sit out the first day of play due to travel issues, will not be able to make it to his team's upper bracket final match against Spirit. HEROIC stunned Complexity in the group stage's opening day as coach Eetu ""sAw"" Saha helped his team to victory from inside the server. HEROIC still hope to get the player to Copenhagen in time for either the group final or consolidation final, depending on how they fare against Spirit today. Four matches are slated for the second day of the BLAST Premier Fall Groups, and two teams will be sent home after lower bracket bouts: OG vs. Complexity in Group A and Falcons vs. GamerLegion in Group B. Teams still in the upper bracket will fight to make it to the final for a chance at qualifying for the Fall Final. In Group A it's a bout between Spirit and HEROIC, while Vitality and Astralis will go up against each other in Group B.",30-7-2024 11:30,1722331800000
Live updates from BLAST Fall Groups day 1,https://www.hltv.org/news/39468/live-updates-from-blast-fall-groups-day-1,"Nothing went the way of Falcons after a pistol round win briefly put them back in the lead. Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard dominated Middle on every one of their approaches and Astralis ran out victors after a 7-1 run. Astralis 6-6  Falcons Falcons were the better team in gunrounds, but dropped the ball at the end up against a low buy and a Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz flank, and Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard followed it up with a 1v2 clutch of his own to end it at 6-6. It all started with a failed knife attempt from Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard, but Martin ""stavn"" Lund stole the show. Mind the hyphen — not bad advice for a relationship, advice for a bad relationship. An interesting analogy to the Falcons situation... I'm not sure it was helpful, but it's something. Astralis 13-7  Falcons There was a brief resurgence from Falcons off of a pistol round win, but Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz has helped put it to bed with a beautiful quad-kill in a 2v4 afterplant situation on B and a subsequent opener in the final round. Here's the deciding play: And here's the final scoreboard for the map: Astralis 9-3  Falcons Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García' ace kept Astralis from reaching double digits in the first half, but it feels like too little, too late. Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz & co. played an aggressive CT side, suffocating Falcons at every opportunity. Astralis 5-2  Falcons Astralis are taking the fight to Falcons with some aggressive pushes down middle on Dust2, but this one went awry due to a back turned, followed by a missed spray, and an accidental weapon switch from three different players. Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz gave an update to James ""BanKs"" Banks about how he's feeling with the team after getting his first few months down as a newly-minted in-game leader. ""I think it's been really good. Ups and downs, of course, the start of the season our first results were a bit better than the end of the season. We had a pretty hectic schedule, so we didn't have a lot of pracc, but now we have had that, so I hope it will be an upwards trend again."" volt to BanKs on the match: ""The game was super exhausting. We were there for ages, especially on that Mirage. On Dust2 we got owned, but I'm pretty happy, and exhausted."" On ztr vs. Snax: ""The style is completely different. We're much, much more controlled now, and slow. The playbook is completely different compared to how it was with Snax, we changed everything on every single map."" On the new lineup's potential: ""We've gotten to a point where with this roster we can do something. It's a long-term project, everyone is super young and everyone is really hungry to win. With the right work, the sky is the limit."" After a spirited performance on the first two maps, GamerLegion's debut ran out of steam on Dust2. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut styled on his opponents with a 2.27-rated performance and ensured Vitality's victory, but their performance will give us more question marks than answers. GamerLegion 5-12  Vitality GamerLegion 2-10  Vitality Looks like Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller prediction was right. Vitality have stomped GamerLegion in the first half of Dust2 and are just three rounds away from victory. GamerLegion 2-3  Vitality After an incredibly quiet Mirage, Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut has racked up 10 kills in the first five rounds and once again leads the way for his team. GamerLegion 17-19  Vitality It wasn't pretty, but they got it done. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's lack of fragging needs to be pointed out, as he missed several sitters on the AWP over the course of the map. However, he found three kills in the final round, so all is forgiven. On to Dust2! GamerLegion 14-13  Vitality GamerLegion 12-12  Vitality A four-round streak at the end of the map is enough to take it to overtime. The turning moment came in round 23, when Andreas ""aNdu"" Maasing and Henrich ""sl3nd"" Hevesi weathered the storm and stabilized a 2vs4 post-plant situation. GamerLegion 7-10  Vitality Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire pointed out Vitality's CT sides as their weakness in the pre-match interview, but they look much better on Mirage. Five in a row off the back of the pistol, and Vitality are in pole position to tie up the series. GamerLegion 7-5  Vitality Vitality won four out of the last six rounds to give themselves a chance, but they really aren't firing on all cylinders. Missed smokes, bad cohesion, and missed shots have been the story of the half. A positive note for them is that the scoreboard is much more even this time around, though. GamerLegion 6-2  Vitality Vitality are once again falling behind on the map as GamerLegion keep finding ways to win rounds. Andreas ""aNdu"" Maasing just stuck the defuse in a 1v1 to put his team four rounds ahead, but their money remains at breaking point. GamerLegion 1-0  Vitality If Vitality were hoping GamerLegion's individuals cooled off in the break, they would be wrong. Andreas ""aNdu"" Maasing isn't messing around. GamerLegion 13-10  Vitality GamerLegion have completed a hard-fought upset on their pick of Anubis. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut gave it his best and found 22 kills, eight more than his closest teammate, William ""mezii"" Merriman, but it wasn't enough. On the GamerLegion side, four of their members were between 21 and 17 kills, as they got the job done by committee — take note, Falcons. Next up is Mirage, where Vitality are on a five-map win streak. GamerLegion 10-10  Vitality Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut has been the only Vitality member providing fragging power so far, but William ""mezii"" Merriman just came up huge with a 4k in an eco round. Game on! GamerLegion 8-8  Vitality GamerLegion have tied up the scores despite Vitality's pistol-round victory. Sebastian ""volt"" Maloș' 3k denied Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's clutch and put his team at the brink of the lead, as Vitality are down to an eco in the next. GamerLegion 6-4  Vitality GamerLegion 5-3  Vitality GamerLegion were looking very comfortable after their first win, stringing together a streak with powerful site holds, but a pop into the B site just about got Vitality another round. GamerLegion 1-2  Vitality Vitality bagged the pistol and conversion on their T side, but Timur ""FL4MUS"" Marev has made sure GamerLegion stay in touching distance early doors. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks on stream regarding Vitality's recent struggles, and the Frenchmen was clear about the main issue. On Vitality's struggles: I will talk a bit about statistics. After London, HLTV did something about the statistics and stuff for the HLTV awards, and they talked about us. We had the best T-side percentage from the first half of the season, but I think on CT we were like 12th. That's a big part of the work for us. I don't think it's about positions, it's the way we play our roles. We lack a lot of multi-kills sometimes, and converting rounds, we're not good enough on the CT side. On any other issues: We also need to be better individually as well, we lacked a lot of things. I think for us it's the two biggest points overall, that and we need to improve our CT sides. It also means something when you are good on T sides, we play good together and have good teamplay etc, but we need to find a way to get better on CT. In a post-match interview with James ""BanKs"" Banks, Complexity coach Tiaan ""T.c"" Coertzen lamented that his troops missed the chance to lock down Vertigo, where they hadn't lost a single game in three months. ""We were just not converting the rounds we were supposed to convert. That game should have been over way before. If you're going to lose 5v3s and you're going to let your economy get fucked by Deagles, you're going to put yourself in a tough spot to close the game out. It's unfortunate. ""Every time we're going B, we're getting flashed, we're getting killed by a guy swinging across. It's basic things that are costing us, and the game never should have got to that point."" On sAw's performance: I'm surprised, to be honest. I never imagined SAW would play like that. They were pushing B on Vertigo, like spam and flashes. When we are playing, he always helps us with where to play. He's not a coach outside of the server. It helps us a lot. It was surprisingly good. On whether his team had a nothing-to-lose mentality because of degster's absence: We cannot be tilted from something we cannot control. We came with this mentality to this game and everything worked perfectly. A flawless T side performance in overtime, coupled with a trio of Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck kills in the final round, sees HEROIC defeat Complexity in a 2-0 fashion. The North American team will rue not being able to lock down Vertigo, where they wasted a 12-10 lead in what was their first defeat on this map in three months. They will now battle for survival against OG, another team struggling for form. Complexity 12-12  HEROIC Despite a stellar rifling performance from Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli, Complexity are unable to put the game to bed. HEROIC fight back from a 12-10 deficit to force overtime, and you have to feel that the momentum is starting to swing. Complexity 3-6  HEROIC The Israeli star is having a spectacular performance on Vertigo, averaging over 140 damage per round. A strong start and an even stronger finish see HEROIC secure Ancient convincingly. Complexity looked likely towards the midway point of the game, but HEROIC kept a very tight defense and didn't concede a single round with guns. Next up is Vertigo, where Complexity will be looking to bounce back. They have won all seven games played on this map in the last three months. ""This kid can clutch."" Yes, he can. Complexity 4-5  HEROIC After a 0-5 start, Complexity seem to be finally getting into their rhythm. They've won four in a row, with Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski leading the charge with 10 frags and a 93 ADR. It's going to be tough for HEROIC without their star AWPer, but Complexity are certainly a team that have their ups and downs and are not unbeatable. It will be interesting to see who takes up the AWP for HEROIC. Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets gave a quick interview to James ""BanKs"" Banks after Spirit's win over OG, and the Russian made it clear his team was focusing on IEM Cologne. On if he feels Spirit can win their group: I don't think about winning the group. We just think about getting into the best shape we can before Cologne, and trying to improve our game. On whether this was an improvement on EWC: Yeah definitely, yes. With every official we play we are getting better. Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia bagging 27 frags on Mirage was vital in ensuring Spirit got over the line in a difficult Mirage. It's Spirit's worst map, and based on this showing, they haven't gone far in improving it. Credit to OG, they recovered well from a spanking on Dust2 to put up a fight on Mirage. OG 8-9  Spirit All credit to OG, they have been far more competitive in this map. It's starting to slip away, but had they converted this eco, it would have been a different story. OG 5-7  Spirit OG 2-4  Spirit It started well for OG, they got a couple of rounds on the board and forced Spirit onto a bad buy. The European squad squandered their chance, losing to a saved AWP. They can't be giving up these kinds of rounds. That wasn't event remotely competitive. Mirage up next. OG 1-7  Spirit Not sure Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets was quite expecting that, judging by his reaction, but he will take those frags happily. OG 0-4  Spirit As expected so far. OG got close in the pistol round, bringing it to a 1v1, but it's been plain sailing for Spirit since. Thomas ""Thomas"" Utting gave an interview with James ""BanKs"" Banks on stream ahead of his matchup with Spirit, and the Brit said he doesn't have any intentions of joining OG permanently. On being asked to stand in: I was in Italy when I got asked, it was kinda surprising. I think they weren't able to find someone in time for their current lineup, I was available to stand in and they asked, so I thought why not give it a go. It's going to be a hard one, but still. On how long OG practiced: Overall I think it's about eight days, eight to do six maps. In reality I think I did a good enough job, but the time is definitely against us. Every team in this tournament are going to have a lot more pre-done, it's going to be an uphill battle. On his roles: I primarily went into all of the IGL roles, it's what I'm most comfortable with. k1to went into HeavyGod's roles. I think that prior they had some sort of miscommunication or something, I dunno, but I don't think k1to wanted to IGL, it's a hard role. So he's feeling more comfortable in this role, and so far he's been doing really good there. On whether he will join OG permenantly: I didn't accept it on that premise, I just wanted the opportunity to test my system in a different style of team, and understand what these guys are doing that I am not. But I never went into the team with intentions of joining, I just want to show I am capable and find something I want to do personally, rather than forcing a team. Esports World Cup was not pretty for Spirit. Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets posted by far his worst LAN event since joining the main roster, they were handily beaten by a brand-new G2 roster, and beaten by G2 without the need for Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov to play particularly well. Spirit entered the player break off the back of a second trophy for the year and as the best team in the world. Can they bounce back after a poor start to this season? Thomas ""Thomas"" Utting and Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson will both be debuting for their respective squads today, OG and GamerLegion. The departure of Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko in the player break has left a gaping hole in OG's roster, as he was clearly their best player during his time with the team. Thomas has been brought in for this tournament, freeing up Nils ""k1to"" Gruhne from leadership duties to take on HeavyGod's roles. Whether the addition of Thomas is a long-term solution remains to be seen, but it will be a tough ask to helo OG be competitive at a tier-one level as the firepower in particular seems to be lacking. As for ztr, he has been entrusted with the leadership of an incredibly young GamerLegion squad after the sudden departure of Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski, and at the tender age of only 20 himself. Martialling a group of teenagers with little top-tier experience will be a challenge. There is, however, certainly a wealth of potential amongst GamerLegion's ranks. Timur ""FL4MUS"" Marev, Andreas ""aNdu"" Maasing and Henrich ""sl3nd"" Hevesi are all highly-touted and have the raw skill to cause problems even for top teams. The fight for a place at BLAST Premier Fall Final begins today, with 16 teams set to contest the six berths on offer, starting with Group A and Group B. Over the course of Fall Groups we will get our first look at several new squads, with household names  Liquid, BIG, and Cloud9 all due to test their latest iterations. For today it's only OG and GamerLegion who will debut new players, Thomas ""Thomas"" Utting and Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson respectively, but teams like Falcons and Astralis will be playing their first official matches since the player break, so there is plenty to get excited about.",29-7-2024 22:00,1722283200000
BIG send Virtus.pro to Fall Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39497/big-send-virtuspro-to-fall-showdown,"The German squad played a fantastic decider after two hard-fought maps. BIG march onwards in the BLAST Premier Fall Groups by virtue of a 2-1 win over Virtus.pro, taking Dust2 (13-11) and Ancient (13-7) either side of a loss on Mirage (10-13). This result eliminates Virtus.pro, whilst BIG progress to a consolidation final matchup with world No. 1 Natus Vincere. Virtus.pro have struggled to hit the heights their roster should be capable of on paper, and with the additions of Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov and later head coach Andrey ""Xoma"" Mironenko, they have also been undergoing a shift of playstyle. Here at BLAST, it seemed that Virtus.pro have some way to go to get themselves in top shape. After an 0-2 loss to Liquid, the Russian side came into this matchup as heavy favorites, considering how poor BIG had been in their opening game, but floundered. Not only did Virtus.pro scrape their pick of Mirage before being outclassed on Ancient, but their individuals struggled to produce enough firepower across the series. BIG, meanwhile, showed a monumental improvement on their performance against Natus Vincere in their opening game. A proactive CT side clinched them Dust2, and they recovered well from a woeful defensive half on Mirage to make that map close as well. On Ancient, the German side were a force to be reckoned with, in no small part thanks to Jon ""JDC"" de Castro. The rifler was a wrecking ball on CT, side taking Mid control and holding down A, and helped crack open bombsites on multiple occasions on the T side as well. Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi continued to struggle much as he had in BIG's opener, which will be the point of concern for the German squad. rigoN has admitted in interviews on broadcast that he has to learn to adapt to his new roles, and on the evidence of this series, he still has a way to go.",2-8-2024 01:01,1722553260000
Talon confirm re-entry into Counter-Strike with AZR-led team,https://www.hltv.org/news/39499/talon-confirm-re-entry-into-counter-strike-with-azr-led-team,"AZR returns with a new team featuring an Oceanic majority and a European AWPer. Hong Kongese organization TALON has officially confirmed its long-rumored re-entry into Counter-Strike with a team captained by former Renegades and 100 Thieves in-game leader Aaron ""AZR"" Ward. The Australian veteran, who last played an official match on record a year and a half ago with Sprout, has returned to link up with former Ninjas in Pyjamas coach Daniel ""djL"" Narancic and form an Oceanic-majority squad with a European AWPer, as reported by HLTV in late June. Former Rooster up-and-comer Corey ""nettik"" Browne and ex Bad News Kangaroos teammates Jared ""hazr"" O'Bree and Christian ""ADDICT"" Pendleton form the rifling trio. They're joined by Polish AWPer Miłosz ""mhL"" Knasiak, who last turned out for 9INE earlier this year in a brief stint on loan from Falcons, where he had been benched since November. The new team will make its debut in HellCase Cup 10, where they will compete in Group D and match up against TSM in the opening game, on Sunday at 14:30 . TALON's CEO, Sean Zhang, shed more light on the move in a video announcement. In it, he revealed the team will be playing from Europe for the majority of the time, in the organization's new facility, so that they can train against the best teams in the world on a consistent basis. Zhang tempered short-term expectations for the new squad but stressed the organization's goal is to develop the Asia-Pacific region in the long term to become among the best in the world. ""We are hoping that we are able to qualify for the Shanghai Major as a short-term goal, but the real objective from now till the end of the year is to get as many tournaments and as many reps in,"" Zhang said. ""For the long term, we want to develop Asian-Pacific-based CS. We've been inspired by teams like MongolZ, and we really feel like the footprint that Talon has can provide a unique opportunity for Asian CS to be given the right opportunities to become the best in the world.""

NAVI Javelins go international after two changes,https://www.hltv.org/news/39500/navi-javelins-go-international-after-two-changes,"Liina and LETi have made way for ASTRA and D7 in the women's team's first move away from an all-Polish roster. Natus Vincere have announced two changes to their women's Counter-Strike roster ahead of the start of ESL Impact League Season 6. The team has parted ways with one of its founding members from early 2022, Karolina ""Liina"" Kasprzyk, as well as Martyna ""LETi"" Owsik, who joined the squad in March 2023. Their replacements are Mayline-Joy ""ASTRA"" Champliaud and Marta ""D7"" Asensio, two mainstays on the women's scene for the past two years. ASTRA was last seen playing alongside her compatriots in France fe and previously competed under Let Her Cook and NIP Impact, while D7 last played for GUILD fe and BIG EQUIPA before that. With the moves, NAVI Javelins move away from an all-Polish team for the first time since the team came together in early 2022. The changes come after a disappointing end to the previous season, which saw the Poles place 5th-6th at the ESL Impact Season 5 Finals despite coming in as one of the two main favorites alongside eventual winners Imperial fe. NAVI Javelins will look to return to contention for titles with their new additions, starting with the next season of ESL Impact league. That is set to kick off at the end of August and culminate with the LAN finals in late November. The new NAVI Javelins lineup is: Wiktoria ""vicu"" Janicka Hania ""Hanka"" Pudlis Angelika ""Angelka"" Kozłowska Mayline-Joy ""ASTRA"" Champliaud Marta ""D7"" Asensio Adrian ""AlcesT"" Chyziak (coach)",2-8-2024 13:53,1722599580000
Complexity eliminate HEROIC from Fall Groups,https://www.hltv.org/news/39501/complexity-eliminate-heroic-from-fall-groups,"The North American squad will face Spirit for a spot in the Fall Final. Complexity came into the BLAST Premier Fall Groups' Group A consolidation match with hunger for revenge as they had lost to HEROIC, who fielded coach Eetu ""sAw"" Saha during their run at the event, on the opening day. This time around the North Americans didn't drop the ball and beat the European combine, whose Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov was still sidelined due to visa issues, in two maps. Complexity switched it up in the veto and went for Anubis, the map which would have been the decider in the first bout between the two teams had HEROIC not won it 2-0. A strong CT side from Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou and his men cleared the way for a dominant display on their pick, as they turned a 9-3 half to a 13-5 victory. Complexity had another strong start on the CT side, this time on Ancient, which they had lost in overtime in the group's opener, but HEROIC managed to bring it back even before the half. Frustration started to creep into the Complexity camp with Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli even banging his desk when down 8-11, but the team rallied and, spearheaded by a fantastic Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski with 28 kills by the end of regulation, snuck through 13-11 to seal the deal without needing to go to a Nuke decider. Complexity, who looked lost in the opener and then had shaky moments when the beat a weak OG 2-1, will now have a chance to show their improvements when they face Spirit in the Group A final with a spot for the Fall Final on the line. HEROIC may look to the IEM Cologne Play-in with some anxiety after degster failed to make it to the tournament in Denmark, as the AWPer will need to have his visa issues sorted before August 7 if he is to compete at the tournament in Germany alongside his teammates.",2-8-2024 14:00,1722600000000
Live updates from BLAST Fall Groups day 3,https://www.hltv.org/news/39486/live-updates-from-blast-fall-groups-day-3,"An absolutely dominant performance on Dust2 by Liquid left Virtus.pro no chance to get into the game, with Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken not missing a beat and finishing atop the board with a 22-10 K-D, six multi-kills, and 122.1 ADR. A match against Natus Vincere awaits Liquid in the upper bracket final of Group D, while Virtus.pro drops down to the lower bracket and will face BIG to avoid getting sent to the Showdown. Liquid 12-6  Virtus.pro Liquid 10-5  Virtus.pro Liquid have hit double digits on Dust2 and are nearing victory, but it isn't coming easy. Petr ""fame"" Bolyshev was fearsome from CT and Catwalk and demolished two players with an MP9, but a great call from Liquid saw them press the issue against him to avoid rotating into a B stack. It took this 1vs3 from Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken to close the round, though, so Liquid's economy isn't looking great as they look to close out. Liquid 7-5  Virtus.pro Liquid's double AWP setup ravaged Virtus.pro for much of the half, with the Russian side barely tallying a fifth round after nearly squandering a 5vs3. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken is looking sharp, as is Liquid as a whole, but a test awaits the Canadian captain as he will need to lead his team to victory on the T side. Liquid 5-4  Virtus.pro Liquid have whipped out the double AWP setup and it is paying dividends, with Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken finding a surprising entry on Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali in Suicide and Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak picking a second player at Barrels and doing 80 damage to another to force the save. Keith ""NAF"" Markovic looks like he is falling asleep and made it clear he is bored of Virtus.pro saving for another round, which didn't pay off as Twistzz's AWP again laid waste to the Russian side. Liquid 1-4  Virtus.pro A pistol win is all Liquid have in hand right now. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's side are playing some brawly Counter-Strike and trying to fight for control everywhere but it isn't paying off, and this squandered 5vs3 just adds insult to injury as Virtus.pro begin to run away with the lead. Liquid 22-20  Virtus.pro What an end to an incredible map of Counter-Strike. Virtus.pro had Liquid on the ropes at times, capitalizing on some errors and catching off rotations, but couldn't overcome a superlative showing from Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak in the final two sets of extra rounds. The Polish AWPer took a while to get going on the map, finding a handful of opening kills in regulation but not quite living up to the praise heaped on him by his teammates based on practice. When it came down to the wire, however, ultimate stood tall and showed a flash of what Liquid likely saw in him when they scouted him: He bagged five multi-kills (14 kills) in the final seven rounds of the game to help his team close out, ending his debut map for Liquid with an impressive flair. We're headed to VP's Dust2 pick next. Liquid 20-19  Virtus.pro Liquid 18-18  Virtus.pro Virtus.pro couldn't convert upon their first map point on Ancient, with Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak heating up and helping his team nab a round to force yet another set of extra rounds. Liquid 17-18  Virtus.pro Liquid 15-16  Virtus.pro One wasn't enough, eh? Virtus.pro went on a 7-1 run to force overtime and take the lead after an intense late-round, 14-13, but Liquid regained footing on the attack to hit map point first with some entries from Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis and Justin ""jks"" Savage. Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali  put up a stonewall defense of A that allowed VP to stave off defeat on Liquid's pick, though, and we're into another set of extra rounds where Virtus.pro has taken the lead. Liquid 13-12  Virtus.pro Liquid 12-12  Virtus.pro It wouldn't be VP without at least one overtime map, and its come early. Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali's 1vs2 turned the tides for his team and VP didn't let up from there, crushing entries on B opening up the avenue for a comeback. An entry kill from Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis gave Liquid a 5vs4 in round 24, but he was left stranded in A Main and VP regrouped B after re-fragging him to force overtime. Liquid 12-9  Virtus.pro A sigh of relief for the Russian squad after they almost lost a 5vs2. This map is still on and Virtus.pro is picking up momentum. Are we headed to overtime? Liquid 12-8  Virtus.pro Liquid are closing in on a comfortable first map victory over Virtus.pro, converting upon Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's quad-kill by runboosting Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak in Middle for a 2K. Justin ""jks"" Savage fared well in the first half and has continued excelling as an A Anchor on the CT side, shutting down A hits and doing a better job of mixing aggression and passivity than Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros did, according to Mohan ""launders"" Govindasamy. Liquid 9-6  Virtus.pro Liquid 8-4  Virtus.pro Virtus.pro kept the battle close at the start of the half, recovering from a 0-3 start to even the score at 4-4, but collapsed after this 1vs3 from Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken. The Canadian captain followed up with a double entry in the next round to firmly shut Virtus.pro down, and Liquid now have a hefty lead heading into their CT side. Liquid 6-4  Virtus.pro Liquid are off to the races with their new roster, and Justin ""jks"" Savage hasn't missed a beat upon returning to the server after ten months. The Australian is 11-6 after ten rounds of play, with Liquid jumping out to an early lead courtesy of a pistol win before Virtus.pro won a eco to get themselves into the game. Some encouragement from Torbjørn ""mithR"" Nyborg during a tactical pause has done well to reinvigorate Liquid, however, with Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken pulling off a 1vs3 clutch to get his team back to winning ways. The final series of the day is underway and it is a barn-burner, offering the first look at the new-look Liquid captained by Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken. The Canadian's debut as an in-game leader will be a trial by fire as the match will be Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak's first at a top-tier LAN and mark Justin ""jks"" Savage's first official in ten months, with an in-form Virtus.pro presenting a formidable opponent on the opposite side of the server. The first map of the series will mark Twistzz's 1,000th map under Liquid's banner, with the game getting underway on Ancient. In a post-match interview with James ""BanKs"" Banks, Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius admitted that he didn't expect BIG to ban Nuke and leave Mirage wide open in the veto. ""Dust2 was their map pick and they prepared a lot for it,"" he said. ""In all honesty, we prepared for Nuke, but they banned it and I had to pick Mirage. We had zero prep on Mirage. I'm a little surprised they let us keep Mirage. It's probably because they have rigoN and he is comfortable on Mirage. Maybe Nuke wasn't a map they wanted to play and they chose Mirage."" BIG's lack of practice on Mirage was noticeable as they posed little threat to Natus Vincere, who quickly put the game to bed to seal a dominant 2-0 victory. The Esports World Cup champions will face the winner of Virtus.pro vs Liquid in Group D's upper bracket final, while BIG will battle for survival against the losing team. It certainly wasn't the debut Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi was hoping for. The Swiss player, who revealed that he is still getting used to playing new roles, struggled to find impact and finished the series at the bottom of the scoreboard. Natus Vincere 9-3  BIG As expected, Natus Vincere came out swinging, led by Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan, both of whom ended the half with 17 frags. BIG have a mountain to climb on the T side to overcome this massive deficit... BIG haven't played Mirage since October 2023, in a 2-1 loss to The Chosen Few in the closed qualifier for ESL Challenger Jönköping. When it comes to LAN matches, it has been a whole year since their last Mirage game, which was played on July 27, 2023, in the Play-In stage of IEM Cologne. Natus Vincere lock down the map with a convincing 4-0 run. Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz's 1v3 clutch breathed some life into BIG's players, but they were dealt a heavy blow in that anti-eco round and never bounced back. Up next is Mirage. Natus Vincere 10-7  BIG Natus Vincere 9-5  BIG Natus Vincere 9-4  BIG BIG's comeback hopes have just taken a massive blow... Natus Vincere 8-4  BIG BIG respond with two late rounds to reduce the deficit to four rounds and keep themselves in the game. They have very little room for error, however, and this pistol round is a must-win for them. Natus Vincere 6-2  BIG Definitely not the start that BIG were looking for, forcing Alexander ""kakafu"" Szymanczyk to call a timeout. Natus Vincere are keeping a very tight defense in this game, with Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan posting a combined 5-1 opening kill record. NAVI's pick of Mirage, a map that BIG haven't played since October 2023, puts a considerable amount of pressure on BIG's shoulders to win Dust2. Unless, of course, they have been practicing the map since picking up Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi? Speaking to BIG's official website, here's what new coach Alexander ""kakafu"" Szymanczyk had to say about new signing Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi: ""rigoN is definitely a very experienced player and he can decide rounds with his feel for the game. His aggressiveness also plays a decisive role and is one of the reasons why we brought him to BIG. We want him to be our ""X-factor"" and thus be able to win rounds for the team. ""He is currently used as a semi-anchor/semi-lurk in the team, meaning we rely on his strong communication and the goal is for him to be traded well. We want to use strategies or play in which he can play aggressively and thus have a big impact on the game."" Speaking to James ""BanKs"" Banks after his team's 2-0 victory over Ninjas in Pyjamas, Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa said that he is getting on well with his G2 teammates and that everyone has been very welcoming. ""It doesn't feel like I'm in G2,"" he said. ""I'm in G2 but I don't feel any pressure at all. I don't feel nervous at all. The guys are really good with me, they are super nice and make me feel comfortable on the team. That's why I don't feel any pressure. "" It was a bit too close for comfort, but G2 did it in the end.  The prospect of overtime loomed after they wasted a 5v3 situation in the 23rd round, but Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov put the game to bed with a 3K in the final round. Ninjas in Pyjamas can take comfort in putting in an improved performance on this map as they prepare for an elimination match against Cloud9. As for G2, they have set up an exciting match against FaZe in the group's upper bracket final. G2 11-9  Ninjas in Pyjamas With no room for error, Ninjas in Pyjamas have won two rounds in a row to make things competitive here on Inferno. All of a sudden, it's a two-round game, and G2's economy is in a bad state. G2 11-7  Ninjas in Pyjamas It's looking dire for Ninjas in Pyjamas, who won both pistols but not much else in this game, making the scoreline feel a lot closer than it actually is. G2 are two rounds away from locking down the series, and unless someone on NIP steps up, the series is about to end. G2 7-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas It was all set for 8 G2 rounds in a row but Alejandro ""alex"" Masanet outdoes Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov in the clutch. You have to think a teammate reminded him that the bomb wasn't planted for him to explain this one. G2 4-3  Ninjas in Pyjamas Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz went 2-6 in openers on Anubis, and is already 1-2 here. Aggressive AWPers like the Ukrainian always struggle against anti-stratting and it does seem like G2 have his number in the early round. G2 0-3  Ninjas in Pyjamas Sorry Isak ""isak"" Fahlén, we had to do it. Much better start to map two for the Swedish anchor. G2 0-3  Ninjas in Pyjamas One for Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz over Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač in the pistol, another over Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski in the anti-force, and then Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov over on A to keep NIP in the lead. More force buys coming NIP's way. G2 13-7  Ninjas in Pyjamas NIP took the fight to G2 but the individual superiority of Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and company was too much. One to forget for Isak ""isak"" Fahlén and Max ""maxster"" Jansson who combined for just eight frags combined. G2 10-7  Ninjas in Pyjamas Back and forth a bit but G2 still have control of the game. Playmaker Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz has lost his life in opening duels two rounds in a row. It's Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač whose role changes, going to B anchor with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa in B Cave and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski anchoring A. G2 9-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas G2 6-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Another new role for Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, who has been good so far in entry duty into the A bomb-site. But Fredrik ""REZ"" Sterner has continued to impress and four rounds is a solid start for NIP on the T sided map. G2 4-1  Ninjas in Pyjamas Well this is a lesson in why you need to convert round 2 after winning the pistol. NIP's money is still in tatters despite saving some guns three rounds in a row. Only a G2 hunt stopped them saving a fourth time, too. G2 0-1  Ninjas in Pyjamas Oh G2. It's not how you want to start a series, as Fredrik ""REZ"" Sterner's trademark USP rings off. We're just five minutes away from another fixture, as the promising new NIP take on Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski's G2. G2 get to ban both Vertigo and Mirage again. On the new Cloud9: ""You don't know tendencies, you can't check their stats. We had to adapt on the fly, and play our own game, it is tough but we managed to do it."" On Inferno struggles, talking to BanKs post-game: ""We didn't have information on how they played, there's no stats. On Inferno I got my ass whooped, I wasn't in the zone, I wasn't calling well. They abused me there so props to them."" But it's all about the bounceback, and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský dominated on Mirage. Just two rounds separate FaZe and Cloud9 but it's the master procrastinators FaZe who win out. They have David ""frozen"" Čerňanský to thank for a monster Mirage — there's a reason he has a 1.23 rating on that map this year. FaZe 14-13  Cloud9 Who knew that having a primary AWPer really helps? Kaisar ""ICY"" Faiznurov has 69 frags and this series isn't over yet. FaZe 12-12  Cloud9 David ""frozen"" Čerňanský is leading a FaZe comeback from 7-10 down on the T side of Mirage. The Slovakian rifler is well past 100 ADR with 24 kills in 24 rounds thus far. Cloud9 are learning that getting a lead over FaZe is one thing, but beating them is another entirely. FaZe 7-6  Cloud9 Cloud9 lost steam and couldn't assert dominance in the closing rounds of the first half, but have now won a crucial retake on the A site to keep it a close affair early on their defense. FaZe 4-5  Cloud9 As FaZe were starting to trend down, Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen came out huge with four kills in Middle to win the clutch and keep his team alive. FaZe 3-3  Cloud9 Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov has been showing up this series so far, and four great kills on the A site of Mirage set it up for Kaisar ""ICY"" Faiznurov to win a 1vs1 clutch against Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants as the two teams continue to brawl in the early rounds. FaZe 2-1  Cloud9 FaZe took the pistol, then lost the forcebuy, then won a forcebuy, and three rounds in we're already going back and fourth. Cloud9 go into the fourth round on an eco, however, in a bid to settle the early rounds. FaZe 7-13  Cloud9 Cloud9 rallied on Inferno, following up an 8-4 CT half with a great attacking side to win amply, 13-7, to close the trifecta of Dust2, Inferno, and Mirage by sending the series to the latter to decide it. FaZe 7-10  Cloud9 Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko played a perfect 1vs2 afterplant on B, flanking Robin ""ropz"" Kool and Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard as they descended on the site to try and defuse the bomb. FaZe 5-9  Cloud9 FaZe won the second round on the CT side after losing the pistol round with two opening kills by a blind David ""frozen"" Čerňanský with a Desert Eagle on the B site, forcing Cloud9 on an eco. FaZe 3-4  Cloud9 Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov nearly stuck a defuse against Robin ""ropz"" Kool with just a fraction of a second left, but let go under pressure from the Estonian and the bomb finally went off. FaZe 1-4  Cloud9 After falling short on their Dust2 pick, Cloud9 looked in control on Inferno as they went up 4-0 and were up against pistols, but two B entries by Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský got the European combine on the board. FaZe 13-10  Cloud9 FaZe managed to pull through in the end in classic FaZe fashion despite nearly giving up a massive 11-2 lead, and take a 1-0 lead in the series ahead of Inferno. FaZe 11-8  Cloud9 After an abysmal 2-10 attacking half, Cloud9 are starting to build momentum on the CT side with AWPer Kaisar ""ICY"" Faiznurov coming alive with a big clutch and strong numbers. FaZe 9-1  Cloud9 It took nine rounds, but Cloud9 are finally on the board after a simple B pop and trading down to a 3vs3 afterplant situation. Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov's men are still struggling on the attacking side of their map pick, though, as they were immediately shut down on the following round. FaZe 6-0  Cloud9 FaZe's Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard is mopping the floor with Cloud9 six rounds in with an average of two kills per round and no deaths as the international squad is soaring to a one-sided 6-0 lead on the CT side. Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants also has 12 frags to his name, with the rest of FaZe on a combined six kills. FaZe 3-0  Cloud9 Cloud9's new roster is on display for the first time since undertaking a major revamp in the off-season. Their first round could have gone better, however, as after an opening kill by Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko they gave up four kills to Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants for FaZe to take the lead. Dust2, Cloud9's pick, will be followed by FaZe's Inferno and, if necessary, the series will keep its classic map energy with a Mirage decider. Translated by Reddit user bsiteblog, here's what Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov had to say about his new teammates to Erik Shokov. ICY: ""You can see that he has a hunter mode. I see him as a beast of prey in every round. ICY needs time and experience and he will be a stable player of the tier 1 scene."" HeavyGod: ""A very positive guy. His worldview is similar to mine. He works hard, wants to win, sometimes gets burned when he gets killed. We look up to him as a starter player."" ""HeavyGod talks a lot in the game - he is the second voice on the team. He is a universal player and is ready to do whatever is asked of him. HeavyGod can play absolutely any role."" interz: ""Even though I hadn't played with him before, I understood perfectly the mind picture of what he was like."" Those quotes in full, from media day with us: ""ropz has been in slumps before. Maybe this one has gone longer than what he is used to. But if you can come through that, you're going to be greater as a player. ""Right now, we're trying to do everything we can to help him. But in the end, he's the one sitting at the PC. It's him who has to believe in himself. I know for sure everyone on our team believes in him. ""We have seen how great he is. We know how great he is. I have played with him for so many years. So I believe he will find a way back and hopefully, it will be sooner than later because he is an important part of the team.""

Magisk carry not enough as Astralis send Falcons to Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39502/magisk-carry-not-enough-as-astralis-send-falcons-to-showdown,"Astralis have earned themselves two chances to qualify for their home country's Fall Finals. Astralis have eliminated Falcons from the BLAST Premier Fall Groups with the second victory over the Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer-led team in five days. Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and company earned their way through to the group final, where they will rematch Vitality for a chance to qualify for the Fall Final, taking place in their home country's capital in September. Last time around, Vitality came out on top of a convincing 2-0 affair. Meanwhile, Falcons have dropped to the Fall Showdown, where they will fight among 14 other teams for just two spots at the Fall Final. Their second loss to Astralis was significantly more competitive than the first, in no small part thanks to Emil ""Magisk"" Reif. The 26-year-old put on a masterclass on Dust2, recording his highest-rated map in Counter-Strike 2 (1.85). A 27-4 score in their 16 round wins spoke volumes of the massive impact Magisk had, carrying his team to an overtime victory with multi-kill after multi-kill, including a quad-kill in the first and this ace in the second pistol round. Astralis replied with a battering on Ancient, a 13-1 scoreline making their intentions clear as the series headed to a deciding Nuke. There, the favorites continued where they left off to start. Falcons made some of their quick approaches work to make it a competitive affair at first, with Magisk once again at the helm, finding some crucial entries. But Astralis ended up running away with it after a key round eight went their way, with device and Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr turning a 3v5 around, and Falcons were too far to make it back from there when they also lost the second pistol. More of Magisk's brilliance didn't do them any good, as the advantages he found with more openings did not get converted, and Astralis ran out victors 13-9.",2-8-2024 17:39,1722613140000
Dominant NAVI relegate BIG to BLAST Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39505/dominant-navi-relegate-big-to-blast-showdown,"NAVI were able to repeat their opening-round victory. Natus Vincere have defeated BIG at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups 2024 with a 2-0 scoreline (Dust2 13-7, Mirage 13-3), eliminating the German team from the tournament. The team led by Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen has now qualified for the group final, where they will face off against Liquid for qualification. ""We have nothing to prove, we will just play the game. It was a good game yesterday, and it will be the same tomorrow,"" Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy said about the upcoming rematch. Meanwhile, this is the end of BIG's road in Copenhagen. The German squad can look back at their victory against Virtus.pro in the lower bracket fondly, but Natus Vincere were a step too far for the new lineup on both occasions. Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi's integration into the system remains a work in progress, but the Swiss rifler had his best map of the tournament on Mirage against Natus Vincere. He put up 16 kills, 112 ADR, and a 1.59 rating, 1.09 more than his nearest teammate. Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks in a post-match interview and gave an honest assessment of their debut tournament with rigoN. ""It's sad how we lost on Dust2, but you better smile about it than be fully in pain,"" the 21-year-old said. ""They just hit great headshots. If you don't win the duels, in the end, it's Counter-Strike, and you need to shoot people."" The series began with Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius' miraculous Revolver quad-kill in the second round that broke BIG's money early on, with Natus Vincere repeating the feat with a full-eco victory in the ninth. All of that meant that despite BIG coming alive late on, Aleksib and company secured a comfortable 13-7 win. Natus Vincere then dominated Mirage from start to finish, as rigoN was the only BIG member able to put up any resistance. That didn't do much for the German side, however, as they found themselves relegated to the Showdown after a one-sided 3-13 loss.",2-8-2024 21:40,1722627600000
Rare Atom qualify for IEM Rio,https://www.hltv.org/news/39503/rare-atom-qualify-for-iem-rio,"kaze and company defeated TYLOO to secure their berth at the Brazilian tournament. Rare Atom won the IEM Rio Asia Closed Qualifier and secured a spot at the Brazilian tournament, taking place from October 7-13. The Chinese squad began the four-team qualifier with a hard-fought victory against ATOX, which earned them an upper-bracket clash against TYLOO. Rare Atom lost the domestic matchup 0-2 and found just nine rounds across the series. They dropped down to the lower bracket, where they once again got the job done against ATOX. That meant Rare Atom were in for a rematch against TYLOO, with the winner securing a spot at the Brazilian event. The first map went in favor of Rare Atom in an overtime affair before TYLOO forced a third map after winning their pick of Anubis.

NIP eliminate FaZe from BLAST Groups,https://www.hltv.org/news/39504/nip-eliminate-faze-from-blast-groups,"It is the first time in four years that FaZe will have to play the Showdown. Ninjas in Pyjamas are through to Group C's Final at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups after a hard-fought win over FaZe. Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz was once again the difference-maker, posting a 1.45 rating as his team came out on top of two games of fine margins, the sort of tests that FaZe used to pass with flying colors. The Ninjas move on to face G2 on Saturday in a qualification match, while FaZe will have to battle their way through the Showdown - the first time since Fall 2020 that they will have to play this tournament. FaZe's lackluster performance highlighted the lack of confidence that has seeped into their game. After the match, Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen confessed he expects IEM Cologne to be ""very rough."" ""We have to push through and adapt on the fly,"" he said. ""I think, most of all, we need to wake up and look at ourselves in the mirror. It comes down to everyone pushing through. It's a mental battle now, which we used to be good at, but sometimes, things change."" He concluded: ""Losing 2-0 to NIP is not good enough with the players we have."" Ancient was all about r1nkle, who racked up 31 frags (24 with the AWP, 16 more than his FaZe counterpart, Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants) to power Ninjas in Pyjamas to a hard-fought 16-14 win. After a quiet first-half showing, David ""frozen"" Čerňanský came alive and helped keep his team in the game, but the good old FaZe magic was nowhere to be seen as they faltered in overtime after coming back from 10-12 down. The Slovakian carried his Ancient form into Inferno, posting 13 frags as FaZe found six rounds on the offense in a highly contested first half. The game then descended into chaos, as mistakes became more frequent and nerves began to take hold of players. A quad-kill from Robin ""ropz"" Kool with a Five-SeveN breathed life into FaZe's team at a critical stage of the game, but the team wouldn't be able to capitalize on it, letting an 11-9 lead slip after a series of close exchanges.",2-8-2024 20:05,1722621900000
Starry joins TYLOO,https://www.hltv.org/news/39508/starry-joins-tyloo,"The Chinese squad made their second roster change of the summer. TYLOO have announced the signing of Lizhi ""Starry"" Ye from Lynn Vision to complete their roster before the Shanghai Major qualification process gets underway. Starry becomes the second ex-Lynn Vision player to make the jump to TYLOO after the Chinese organization completed the signing of Dongkai ""Jee"" Ji in June. Starry represented Lynn Vision for three years and made his first breakthrough in the tier-one scene at the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown 2021, where he famously clutched a 1v5 situation against G2. The Chinese rifler has shown fantastic form during 2024, too, averaging a 1.19 rating across 67 maps of play, which helped Lynn Vision briefly enter the top 30 and solidify their status as the No. 2 team in Asia. The new-look TYLOO will debut against Gaimin Gladiators at XSE Pro League 2024, a LAN tournament set to take place in Quzhou, China, from August 3-6.

Live updates from BLAST Fall Groups day 5,https://www.hltv.org/news/39498/live-updates-from-blast-fall-groups-day-5,"Natus Vincere got the job done with a comfortable 2-0 victory to get themselves within one win away from the BLAST Fall Final and eliminate BIG in the process. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen will face Liquid for qualification, while BIG's focus shifts to their home event, IEM Cologne. Natus Vincere 7-2  BIG Natus Vincere 5-0  BIG BIG haven't gotten going yet and are already 0-5 down on NAVI's pick. They need to find some rounds soon, or they might be heading to the Showdown. Natus Vincere 13-7  BIG The Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius Revolver 4k and a full-eco victory were enough for Natus Vincere to breeze to a confident 13-7 victory on BIG's pick — the same scoreline to their opening match in Copenhagen. Next up is Mirage, where Natus Vincere won 13-3 last time around. Natus Vincere 10-5  BIG Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa's aggression has given BIG a lifeline. The 21-year-old made the most out of the new boost box on Short and took a quick peek towards Mid to net himself a 3k. Natus Vincere 5-4  BIG ""Go ahead, take a lead, it's USPs,"" said Conner ""Scrawny"" Girvan at the start of the round, but Natus Vincere had other ideas. Natus Vincere 1-1  BIG Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks ahead of the match and said he is hopeful of a better individual performance. On win against VP: ""We just saw how they play and played slow but we had some fast rounds too. It felt good to win, but it is still nothing. We just try to improve game by game."" On his individual form: ""I know myself as a player and I know what I can do. In the first game I was just lost, I was just listening to tabseN. But today it's going to be better."" NIP have done it! They beat FaZe in two extremely close maps to stay alive in the Fall Groups and send their opponents to the Showdown. The first map was all about Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz, but Inferno was a pure all-around performance coming out of the Ninjas. Still, it's worth mentioning the incredible Inferno game that Max ""maxster"" Jansson had, with a slew of impactful rounds and a 1.26 rating. FaZe 9-9  Ninjas in Pyjamas And just like that, the score is tied once again as FaZe hit back on a very weak buy. Nerves are starting to take hold here... FaZe 8-9  Ninjas in Pyjamas FaZe's hopes have been dealt a huge blow after losing a round to Desert Eagles. They have to save this round, which means that NIP are in a prime position to enter double-digit territory... FaZe 7-8  Ninjas in Pyjamas Robin ""ropz"" Kool picks up a key quad-kill with the Five-SeveN in a round where FaZe had almost nothing to work with. FaZe 6-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas A closely contested first half ends with the score tied at six rounds. It was looking dire for FaZe for a while, but, just like on Ancient, they refused to let the game get out of hand and won the final two rounds of the half. David ""frozen"" Čerňanský was in impressive form in the first half, averaging 132 damage per round. FaZe 1-3  Ninjas in Pyjamas With two round wins in each half, Ninjas in Pyjamas secure their map in overtime in this elimination series. What a fantastic performance from Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz, who posted a 1.56 rating as he racked up 31 frags, including 24 AWP kills! FaZe 12-12  Ninjas in Pyjamas Just like in the first half, FaZe won the final two rounds to equalize the score, sending the game to overtime. But can they keep up their momentum? After posting just one frag on the CT side, David ""frozen"" Čerňanský now has 12 kills to his name. Welcome to the game, frozen FaZe 6-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas FaZe 4-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz has been a thorn in FaZe's side in gun rounds on this first map. Ten rounds into the game, he is sitting on a 12-4 score and is averaging over 103 damage per round. The Ninjas are now in control of the economy, while FaZe are strapped for cash. Speaking to James ""BanKs"" Banks ahead of the series against Ninjas in Pyjamas, Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen once again delved into FaZe's current woes and admitted that ""there is a lot of work ahead"" to put the team back on track. On FaZe's current issues: ""We're playing really badly right now. It's very simple. There are so many micro issues that it's hard to navigate what we need to focus on, what we need to do, teamplay, calling-wise, energy levels, communication in advantageous situations. ""There is a lot of work ahead of us, and it's obviously hard to navigate where you're in a situation where you're trying to focus on different things and you lose games differently."" On whether this is the toughest spell since he's been with FaZe: ""I've been here a few times in my career, I'd say. It's always hard to navigate once you're in it. In the end, the game is about teamplay. In the end, it's about finishing a round. Sometimes, there is a good call or a bad call, but we have to finish the round. And right now, I don't think anything is very positive. It's hard, but it's also about continuing to believe and continuing to work. ""We're still doing that. But I just wish we could click more. We click sometimes, but then the next game we don't click. And it's hard to keep taking steps back. We want to win, right? But we also have to be realistic. We're not at the level where we can beat a top 5 team consistently."" Astralis 13-9  Falcons Falcons bow out of the Fall Groups after the rematch goes against them as well. This time it was a more competitive affair, but they were still dominated by Astralis on Ancient and Nuke was in Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz's team's control for the most part as well. Astralis move on to the group final, where they will rematch Vitality tomorrow at 14:30 . Astralis 12-9  Falcons After hitting 11 off the pistol round win, Astralis struggled to break through the defenses, but they finally stopped the Falcons run with a quick upper hit and a Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard double on the entry. Astralis 11-7  Falcons Deagle in the back... NiKo knows something about that. So painful to watch, but we've all been there. Astralis 8-4  Falcons Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz found some crucial picks outside thanks to a couple of well-timed smoke breaks and Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr complemented him with a few crucial multi-kills to keep Astralis well in the lead. Emil ""Magisk"" Reif is once again the man leading the charge for Falcons with 5-0 in openers, but they failed to convert a couple of his finds. They found the most success in quick approaches, and that was the case again in the closing round of the half. Astralis 5-3  Falcons A quick charge up ramp followed by an upper rush gave Falcons a way in, but they then failed to equalize the map in a 5v3 advantage as Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr combined in a well-timed rotation to the lower bombsite. Astralis 4-0  Falcons device caught just the right timing to flank from hut to catch Magisk unawares and close out the 1v2. Astralis 2-0  Falcons Astralis 13-1  Falcons At least they didn't prolong Falcons' misery. A quick pistol round and anti-forcebuy and we're off to map three after the dominant affair. Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García's reaction sums that map up pretty well. Astralis 11-1  Falcons After dominating map one, Emil ""Magisk"" Reif started out Ancient 0-6, but he and Falcons are now on the board off of his quad-kill. Not that it is making any difference, though. Astralis went right back to where they started and stamped out the rest of the half. A famous Paul ""ReDeYe"" Chaloner quote makes an appearance in this cast. ""What can you even say about that one? Brutal, savage, rekt,"" Henry ""HenryG"" Greer says as Astralis hit 9-0. Astralis 6-0  Falcons Discounting the fifth round where Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz had to salvage a scary anti-eco, Astralis have been in complete control on the T side of Ancient so far. Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr's three openers have given them all the space they needed in the crucial rounds and they're unanswered so far. Astralis' team effort was not enough in the end as Falcons closed it out 16-13. It's been all about Emil ""Magisk"" Reif throughout the map, but Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García also deserves his flowers for some late impact — getting Falcons to overtime in the first place and then some crucial openers once there. He's up to 10 multi-kills and well past 30 kills in total now as Falcons edge to the first map victory. This time, he salvaged a scary 1v4 attempt from Alexander ""br0"" Bro to secure map point. Astralis nearly completed the comeback in regulation after a 7-1 run, exploiting the lack of form on Falcons' individuals as they mostly managed to avoid the red-hot Emil ""Magisk"" Reif. In the end, though, Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García found a crucial double on short to force overtime, and has now found an opening kill to boot once there. Falcons 11-8  Astralis Astralis have been dodging Emil ""Magisk"" Reif like the plague, and once he moved to A they finally decided to attack B head-on, only to fall at the hands of Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen instead. The Emil ""Magisk"" Reif show goes on. Falcons 6-3  Astralis Emil ""Magisk"" Reif is on fire. He's 13-3 and has three clutches to his name. Falcons 5-2  Astralis I can't say I've heard that before, Henry, but it worked out this time. Falcons retain the lead thanks to a couple of nifty shots from Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer. Meanwhile, Emil ""Magisk"" Reif is racking up impact with a quad-kill in the pistol, a 1v2 clutch in the second-round anti-forcebuy and a double in the halfbuy win. The veto between Astralis and Falcons went the exact same way as in their first match a few days ago, which went Astralis' way 2-0. Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz says it's for the losing team to adjust: ""I'm not too worried about it, I've tried these situations. When you're the losing team you think more about what went wrong. They've gotta bring something else than last time."" HEROIC 11-13  Complexity Complexity were down 11-8 on Ancient, but they powered their way to a 13-11 victory in regulation with a fantastic Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski contributing 28 kills in regulation. HEROIC 7-6  Complexity HEROIC's coach went a bit silent on the attacking side of Ancient with only one frag to his name, but he's back on the defense with a double in the pistol round top help HEROIC take the early lead in the second half. HEROIC 4-5  Complexity HEROIC are trying to keep the series alive on Ancient. A lost B hit in pistols and a no-plant forcebuy set the European squad back, but they are slowly clawing their way back to a close half from a 1-5 deficit. HEROIC 5-13  Complexity Complexity have taken their map pick comfortably and lead the series 1-0. The match now goes to Ancient, where HEROIC beat the North Americans 13-8 in the opening bout. HEROIC 3-9  Complexity Complexity are looking much better than they did on the opening day already, taking a 9-3 lead on the CT side of Anubis. Only a major meltdown could stop them from taking the T-sided map on the attack with such a strong lead. HEROIC 1-5  Complexity Complexity have started in their quest for revenge against HEROIC on Anubis, which they picked over Vertigo this time around. Following will be Ancient, HEROIC's pick, and if necessary the series will go to a Nuke decider. HLTV was told on Thursday that HEROIC will once again field coach Eetu ""sAw"" Saha in place of Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov, who has not been able to travel to Denmark with the rest of the team. The European squad already shocked Complexity with their coach in the opening match, winning the bout 2-0 on Ancient and Vertigo. Four teams will move on to their respective group's grand finals, while four teams will be sent home as all of the group stage's consolidation finals take place today. Three of the four bouts are opening-day rematches. FaZe vs. Ninjas in Pyjamas, who play for the first time after Alejandro ""alex"" Masanet and his men took out Cloud9 in a close three-map series in the first round of the lower bracket, is the sole exception.",2-8-2024 21:13,1722625980000

Spirit edge out Complexity to earn Fall Final spot,https://www.hltv.org/news/39510/spirit-edge-out-complexity-to-earn-fall-final-spot,"Spirit lock in their place at the Copenhagen event after a heard-earned victory over Complexity. Spirit are the first team to secure a spot at the BLAST Premier Fall Final, which will take place at Forum Copenhagen from September 25-29. The Russian side topped Group A at the Fall Groups after a hard-earned victory over Complexity in the final, recovering from a double-overtime loss on Dust2 and a 6-10 deficit on the deciding Nuke. Complexity still have one more chance to qualify in Sunday's Play-in stage match against the loser of Liquid vs. Natus Vincere. The Russian side came into the match as massive favorites given Complexity's dwindling form and the fact that they picked into three maps Spirit hadn't lost since March, but it turned out a much more competitive match than anticipated. Despite Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets dropping highlight after highlight and combining with Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov for 67 kills on Dust2, Complexity came out victorious from the double-overtime affair. They showed strong mental fortitude after throwing away a chance to close the map in first overtime, to sh1ro's AWP in a 2v5 situation. Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski was the man at the helm and played a big part in getting the game to overtime, but throughout the map everyone from Complexity stepped up in crucial moments in a big team effort. An Anubis pick then backfired as Complexity came nowhere near to ending Spirit's eight-map winning streak. A loss to a full eco round smoke defuse served as an early signal of the North American team's demise, and Spirit ran away with the map 13-6. Nuke was left to decide, where Spirit had also amassed a six-map streak since March. The favorites were in control at first on the Terorrist side thanks to sh1ro pulling off a last-second 1v2 clutch, but they ended up having their work cut out for them. Clip: sh1ro pulls off a last-second 1v2 clutch Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli came alive on the CT side with a 1v2 clutch in round nine and he continued to punish Spirit to allow Complexity to close the half with five in a row. With a pistol round to boot, the North American side edged closer to victory as they reached double digits first, and hoped to break Spirit's economy. That's when Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov stepped up to the plate with a crucial quad-kill, turning around a 3v5 to save Spirit's bacon and set off a defensive streak. sh1ro then broke Complexity's hearts as they narrowly missed out on a halfbuy victory, with the AWPer securing another clutch in the last fraction of a second possible to help Spirit close it with seven in a row. Clip: sh1ro denies Complexity a halfbuy win with another 1v2 A self-critical Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks after the match, saying Spirit have not been at their best game despite the win. The Ukrainian himself had an off-series, and admitted as much in the comment. ""On Dust2 we felt like we weren't in the game. It was a bad performance by me, especially,"" he said. ""On Nuke there were a lot of strange rounds, we aren't in the best shape overall. There are a lot of stupid things happening on the server, and this is not the best CS you have seen from us.""",3-8-2024 16:23,1722694980000

Vitality have emerged as the victors of Group B of the BLAST Premier Fall Groups 2024, besting Astralis in a tight 2-1 fashion in order to claim a place at the BLAST Premier Fall Final in late September. The international side have now extended their streak of wins over Astralis to three series in a row, having also bested them earlier in the Fall Groups and in ESL Pro League 19. Astralis's pick of Vertigo saw both sides clambering to move past one another throughout the first half, with the Danes ultimately eking out a 7-5 lead at half-time. A pistol win for Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's men allowed them to wrest control of the game, but Astralis eventually stabilized their defense to lock down their pick 13-10. The Danish side hit the ground running on Mirage, racking up a beefy 7-0 scoreline on the CT-side, making it seem like their reaching the Fall Final was practically a guarantee. Despite the daunting circumstances, Vitality rallied to produce a 5-7 half, soon marching into the lead after bagging the second pistol round. Astralis interjected with occasional T-side rounds, but it was not enough to stop Vitality from locking down the map 13-10. Clip: mezii prevents Staehr from securing a 1v3 clutch The decider of Nuke provided yet another back-and-forth affair, with Astralis ultimately claiming a 7-5 scoreline at the half even despite some heroics from Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut.

G2 have locked up a spot at the BLAST Premier Fall Final thanks to a comfortable 2-0 victory over Ninjas in Pyjamas. Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski's troops join Spirit and Vitality in qualifying for the event in Copenhagen, which is slated to start on September 25. It was a one-sided victory for G2, who outperformed their opponents in every department. Still, their display was not without fault, with Snax admitting after the series that his team was not fully focused. ""But even with the kind of mistakes we made, it was pretty okay,"" he said. ""I didn't feel the pressure."" Ninjas in Pyjamas will now be thrown into another qualifying match against Astralis on Sunday. The team's fans will be hoping for an improved performance from star player Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz, who had a quieter afternoon than his impressive debut against FaZe. Shortly before the match, Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov had said that the Ukrainian's tendency to be hyper-aggressive was sometimes his undoing.  ""He's playing really well. He's a really aggressive AWPer. I think sometimes he's overdoing it, and you can easily punish a mistake."" The Ukrainian had the most AWP kills on both maps (10 on Ancient and seven on Inferno), but his presence was barely felt, apart from a few good rounds. The series kicked off on Ancient, where G2 raced out to an 8-4 lead with a dominant CT display by m0NESY, who racked up 16 frags in the half. r1nkle had been a joy to watch against FaZe on this map the day before, but he lacked the same impact in the game, with Max ""maxster"" Jansson stealing the show on the T side with a couple of multi-kill rounds. Ninjas in Pyjamas were helpless to prevent G2 from reaching map point early in the second half.

Clip: r1nkle with two no-scope kills in a row: G2 maintained their momentum on Inferno and stormed out to a 6-2 lead on the T side, only to lose their focus and let Ninjas in Pyjamas post four unanswered rounds. A comeback would not come to fruition, however, as the Ninjas struggled immensely on the offense and grabbed only two rounds in the second half.",3-8-2024 21:18,1722712680000

Liquid move on to Fall Final at NAVI's expense,https://www.hltv.org/news/39516/liquid-move-on-to-fall-final-at-navis-expense,"NAVI were unable to secure revenge for their earlier loss in Group D. Liquid have come out on top in their Group D rematch versus Natus Vincere, moving past Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's men 2-1 after a lengthy, hotly-contested series. This result comes just days after Liquid's previous victory over Natus Vincere, where the Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken-led squad recovered from a devastating 13-2 loss on Mirage to send Natus Vincere to the lower-bracket. The series kicked off on Natus Vincere's selection of Nuke, where the European combine got off to a stellar start, accruing a 10-2 lead on the defense thanks to impactful plays from Mihai ""iM"" Ivan and Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov. Although Liquid had a strong defense of their own, Natus Vincere managed to leverage their lead to close out the map 13-9. Liquid's pick of Anubis shaped up to be much more of a brawl, with an early streak of five rounds by Natus Vincere soon whittled away by Liquid's defense. After the side swap, Twistzz's troops pieced together an impressive T-side, characterized by winning out a number of man-disadvantage situations. Clip: A 1v3 from iM extends NAVI's T-side lead Although Natus Vincere managed to force overtime, Aleksib's men were unable to get it over the line on their opponent's pick, as Liquid closed out the map 16-14. The decider of Inferno was a tale of two huge streaks, as Natus Vincere responded to an early 3-0 run from Liquid with a nine-round run on the defense, putting the European side in full control at the side swap. Clip: Liquid claim match point after a hectic round Liquid were not dismayed by their unfortunate T-side, however, as the team found new life on the defense, powered by a stellar showing from Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak. Allowing just a single round to slip away in the second half, Liquid marched on to snag Inferno 13-10 to cement themselves over Natus Vincere for the second time.",4-8-2024 00:45,1722725100000
Astralis demolish NIP to qualify for Fall Final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39520/astralis-demolish-nip-to-qualify-for-fall-final,"A lackluster showing by r1nkle allowed Astralis to cruise to victory. Astralis have defeated Ninjas in Pyjamas in a two-map series (Mirage 13-6, Inferno 13-5) to secure their spot at the BLAST Premier Fall Final held in Copenhagen. ""We played really well, and NIP are probably a better team than they showed today,"" Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz said in a post-match interview. ""It's been a decent tournament. We had some really good moments against Vitality, even though we lost. We're happy to get the season started."" Astralis' victory was made much easier by a substandard series by Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz. The Ukrainian AWPer averaged a 0.62 rating across the series and was ineffective on the AWP, finding only four kills with the Big Green. Despite their one-sided elimination, Richard ""Xizt"" Landström was proud of his team's achievements in Copenhagen. ""We can't get too greedy with how good we want to be results-wise. We're facing really good teams and have some young players, so we just need a bit of time and experience."" The teams met in the play-in after coming second in their respective groups, with Astralis bested by Vitality, while Ninjas in Pyjamas couldn't get the better of G2. The series began on Mirage, where the Danes breezed to a 13-6 victory despite losing to a near-full eco in the second half. The Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard (1.78 rating) and Martin ""stavn"" Lund (1.57) duo was simply too much to handle for Alejandro ""alex"" Masanet and company, who were visibly second-best on their map pick. Clip: Staehr wins 1vs3 Inferno was an even worse map for Ninjas in Pyjamas, as they could only post five rounds despite winning both pistols. The team, which seemed like a mere shadow of the one that defeated FaZe two days ago, struggled to perform and ended their campaign in Copenhagen on a sour note.",4-8-2024 16:45,1722782700000

NAVI lock down sixth BLAST Fall Final spot,https://www.hltv.org/news/39521/navi-lock-down-sixth-blast-fall-final-spot,"After a labored run, the world's No. 1 team secured the last Fall Final spot on offer in the BLAST Groups. Natus Vincere have secured the sixth Fall Final spot on offer at the Fall Groups after taking down Complexity 2-0 in the second and last match of the Play-in stage. The Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen-led side thus ends a rather labored run through the Groups, which saw them lose to Liquid twice, in successful fashion. After failing their first qualification attempt to Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's team, NAVI made their second against Complexity count. It wasn't without difficulty, as Complexity had their chances to win the close-fought Anubis. They were leading the map 6-1 on the less favored CT side until NAVI turned it all around at the final hour thanks to a halfbuy win starring Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius with a MAC-10 in hand and Aleksib finding crucial entries on the red-hot Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski at the closing of the half. Another low buy win courtesy of Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov's Deagle and Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy's 1v2 as well as a 3v4 retake of the A bombsite in the final two rounds of regulation ended up tipping the first map in NAVI's favor. Clip: b1t tips Anubis in NAVI's favor in a round 23 halfbuy win Nuke was under Natus Vincere's control from start to finish. Complexity couldn't replicate their form against Spirit from the previous day as EliGE struggled throughout the defensive half, and NAVI ran away with a 9-3 offensive half. b1t then put salt in the wound with this play through a smoke in round 15, which gave way to a quick closing of the series. Clip: Another big b1t play puts salt in the wound After the match, jL spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks about NAVI's run through the group stage. He admitted it wasn't smooth sailing but stressed it was a good thing they got ""exposed"" before they head to IEM Cologne next week. ""It's good that we got exposed here so that we can focus on Cologne,"" the Lithuanian said. ""I think it was B1ad3's master plan all along. Play five games so we get the most practice and be ready for Cologne. Jokes aside, our mistakes got exposed and we can fix them."" The six teams through to the BLAST Premier Fall Final, taking place on September 25-29, are the following: Two more will join them from the 16-team Fall Showdown, which will take place online from August 21-25.",4-8-2024 19:18,1722791880000
Live updates from BLAST Fall Groups day 4,https://www.hltv.org/news/39493/live-updates-from-blast-fall-groups-day-4,"After two hard-fought maps, BIG were comfortable on the decider of Ancient to seal the series. Jon ""JDC"" de Castro was an absolute beast on Ancient, Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische was impactful on the AWP throughout the series, but it must be said Virtus.pro struggled badly on the final map. Virtus.pro head home as a result of this result and will have to fight through the Showdown, whilst BIG have earned a consolidation final matchup with Natus Vincere. BIG 11-7  Virtus.pro BIG have been the better side on this map. A varied T side has had Virtus.pro scrambling, and BIG's individuals have done very well at taking control of their respective areas of the map and finding openings in the slower rounds. BIG 8-4  Virtus.pro Some stellar work by Jon ""JDC"" de Castro and Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa, who have 15 and 11 frags apiece, has earned BIG a strong lead at halftime. BIG were so good fighting for Mid and Lane control, and Virtus.pro couldn't really find an answer. It might have been an even bigger lead had BIG not gotten so antsy in the face of a B execute towards the end of the half: BIG 4-3  Virtus.pro Welp, just when BIG's economy was broken and it seemed Virtus.pro would build up a buffer... BIG 3-3  Virtus.pro A messy game thus far. Flanks on flanks, gaps all over the place, and more people have been shot in the back or side of the head than in straight up duels. Even stevens at this point, but BIG's money is in a delicate spot. BIG 2-0  Virtus.pro Such a nightmare for BIG. They had done so much good work to come back into the map, their trading on T side absolutely on point, only to squander it to a half-buy and a saved AWP. If not for their utterly woeful CT side, BIG might have been able to win this series in two. Instead we go to a decider. BIG 5-11  Virtus.pro BIG 4-8  Virtus.pro A very un-syrsoN round from Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische has helped BIG scrape a couple more rounds onto the scoreboard, making the second half far more doable for the Germans. All in all it was a poor CT half, but they've done just enough to perhaps make the map competitive. BIG 2-7  Virtus.pro BIG 2-5  Virtus.pro BIG's CT side has been ugly since guns came up. They have been repeatedly caught out by Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov simply walking out of Palace, their defense has been too static and rotations too slow, and they've gambled away from B multiple times and been exposed for it. BIG 13-11  Virtus.pro BIG got proactive towards the end of their CT half, a little braver in taking control and making picks, and it bore fruit. It required some missed shots, Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali missed a key one on Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa's Long House flank, but the fine margins decide maps as tight as this. BIG take their pick, Mirage up next. BIG 9-9  Virtus.pro Dust2 is a T-sided map I guess. BIG have looked a little disjointed on their CT side, finding it difficult to reorganize their defense in the mid-rounds. Virtus.pro meanwhile have been much improved, but perhaps it's more to do with the switch of sides than anything else. BIG 8-4  Virtus.pro It took some wild and whacky antics for Virtus.pro to stop BIG's run of rounds, but either way the Germans have posted a dominant half. BIG 5-2  Virtus.pro Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi's blushes aside, BIG are dominating this half of Counter-Strike thus far. Virtus.pro are experiencing difficulties holding both sites, but they've lost too many opening kills at Long in particular. BIG 2-0  Virtus.pro An incredibly ugly clutch, but they all count. Liquid move on to the Group D final after a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Natus Vincere. Just when it seemed that NAVI were going to force overtime, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's troops put the game to bed on a Hail Mary force buy. Impressive recovery from Liquid, who came back from 0-7 down to win the map and send NAVI to the consolidation final. Natus Vincere 11-12  Liquid Natus Vincere 8-8  Liquid NAVI tie up the game and get back on the scoreboard after a rough period. Can they build on this and halt Liquid's momentum? Natus Vincere 7-3  Liquid All of a sudden, it's three rounds in a row for Liquid, who are taking the game to their opponents and finding success in early exchanges. How many more rounds will they be able to pick up before the half is over? Natus Vincere 7-0  Liquid Seven rounds into the game, Liquid still haven't found a way to keep NAVI at bay. Torbjørn ""mithR"" Nyborg has already called his second timeout. Can they find a way back into the game? Natus Vincere respond to their Anubis loss with a demolition job on Mirage. Liquid were never really in the game, and they must shake off this ugly loss as the series heads into the decider, Inferno. Natus Vincere 10-2  Liquid The first half of Mirage ends with Natus Vincere on double-digit territory. Once again, it's Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy leading the charge: He already has 17 frags to his name (eight more than anyone else on his team), and he sports a 130 ADR. It looks like this game is a foregone conclusion. Natus Vincere 5-0  Liquid Liquid capitalize on their map pick as they run out 13-11 winners on Anubis. It was looking dire after the first half, but they turned it around with a spectacular T-side performance. Natus Vincere were made to pay the practice for a lackluster defense, with Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy looking like the only player who was up to the challenge. Natus Vincere 8-9  Liquid It has been a flawless half from Liquid on the T side, with Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis jumping to the top of the scoreboard with some impactful rounds. All of a sudden, Natus Vincere are on the back foot. Natus Vincere 8-4  Liquid A very solid T display coming out of NAVI, and the scoreline could have been even more one-sided if Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis hadn't won that sneaky 1v2 clutch. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy ended the half with a 15-7 score, five multi-kills and a 102 ADR. Natus Vincere 5-2  Liquid Liquid's inability to string rounds together is really costing them in this game. Keith ""NAF"" Markovic and Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken have a combined 15 frags, but the rest of the team has five kills between them... A troubling sign as we reach the midway point of the half. After picking Ancient yesterday against Virtus.pro, Liquid now went for Anubis, one of NAVI's worst maps. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's troops responded with a Mirage pick, then leaving Inferno as the decider. Although they have only played the map once in the last 3 months, NAVI hammered G2 on it 13-6 at the Esports World Cup. Ninjas in Pyjamas had to fight hard across the last two maps, but the squeaked over the line 13-11 on both to secure the series. The majority-Swedish side seemed to have a better understanding of Anubis, putting up a strong CT side thanks to proactivity in the right moments. They almost squandered things with some silly rounds on their offense, but a 3v5 win sealed the deal at the death. Cloud9 11-11  Ninjas in Pyjamas That might prove very costly for Ninjas in Pyjamas, they fail to throw utility or trade against an MP9 and lose the bomb in no-mans land. Cloud9 9-7  Ninjas in Pyjamas Such a vital round for Ninjas in Pyjamas as it has broken Cloud9's economy. Cloud9 9-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas Ninjas in Pyjamas seemed to be getting the better of a hectic round, only for Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko to come up trumps. Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov seemed to enjoy that, and he had some words for Ninjas in Pyjamas afterwards. Cloud9 8-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 4-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Neck and neck so far in this half, but Ninjas in Pyjamas will be the happier of the two sides as they are on the unfavoured CT side. Cloud9 look a little lost for ideas if their initial plan hits a roadblock, whilst Ninjas in Pyjamas have done a nice job of disrupting the offense. Cloud9 11-13  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 won seven rounds in a row after a fast A rush to bring it from 4-12 to 11-12. The call from spawn was to hit A fast again, but this time around Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz came alive with three kills on the defense to drag Ninjas in Pyjamas through the finish line and force the Anubis decider. Cloud9 5-12  Ninjas in Pyjamas Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko got an amazing spray transfer to open up Cloud9's first round win on the attack, although it will take a minor miracle for the Russians to come back from a 5-12 deficit. Cloud9 4-8  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 took an early lead from 0-2 to 3-2 with guns in play, but once Alejandro ""alex"" Masanet and his men hit their stride on the attack they won six on the trop to take an 8-4 lead at the half with views of extending the series to a third map. Cloud9 0-1  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 13-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Five rounds on the CT side turned the 8-4 scoreline at the half into a 13-4 victory. Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz shined with the AWP, but otherwise Ninjas in Pyjamas were no match for Cloud9 on Mirage. Up next will be NIP's Ancient pick. Cloud9 8-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Ninjas in Pyjamas got their bearing late in the first half and were gunning for a two-round deficit as Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz got an ace, but it was too late as he had no time to defuse after the feat. Cloud9 2-2  Ninjas in Pyjamas On Ancient: ""We were a bit sleepy. We don't like these early games. We had really bad post-plants at the start of the half, they won clutches and we didn't communicate properly."" On his own form: ""Since CS2 I'm really playing a lot, that's not an issue. Of course, when you make some changes, you want to show to them as well that you're the player that everyone remembers and be a good example to the other players. That's what I tried to do, but as long as we are winning I don't care about my own performance."" Welp, that was underwhelming for a game of the day. The new G2 go from strength to strength. It's a statement series for Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač who is still under pressure to recover his CS:GO form. FaZe 2-9  G2 Even 9-0 up, you don't want to give FaZe a sniff. And Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski may have done just that... FaZe 0-8  G2 Even Mirage expert David ""frozen"" Čerňanský is 3-8. FaZe are nowhere to be found. FaZe 0-4  G2 An on-form Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa (3K in the first gun) and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač (3 in the pistol) are a terrifying prospect as a team's third and fourth stars. FaZe are finding that out, let me tell you. On Snax and Inferno: ""Inferno has been our best map, one of our best ever since I joined G2. Snax kind of has to get used to it, it's stupid not to play it when we're already really good at it. ""It takes time. Changing IGL on a map is not an easy thing. It takes way more time than replacing a regular player. He needs to know the map, study the map, know all the rotations. We are doing fine but it's not as good as it was on HooXi. ""On the veto itself, I was not involved, but we are practicing Mirage a lot and we are comfortable there. We haven't played it much as well, so it's good to have Mirage officials under our belt."" This makes sense from Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač: If you're going to try a new map, why not do it in a low-stakes tournament with no elimination on the line? A closer game than the score suggests, but all the key moments went G2's way. It doesn't help that Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa was in absolutely stunning form throughout — in positions he has struggled in this year. Good stuff from Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, too. FaZe 6-10  G2 The best Deagle on G2? This kid is crazy. FaZe 6-9  G2 He may not play Cave anymore but Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard still has a wallbang in him. FaZe on a five-round streak. FaZe 3-9  G2 Okay Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, we won't question your Ramp play again. Our deepest apologies. Just three rounds for FaZe at the half. FaZe 1-8  G2 Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, despite a noticeable whiff on Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen, is 12-4 with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa as G2 put FaZe to the sword. FaZe's struggles on their home map continue. FaZe 0-4  G2 No dramas for G2 at the start of Nuke as the pistol gets converted and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa grabs four on the MP9 in a 3v5. There's pressure on malbsMd on Nuke; it's always been his worst map and he rarely looks comfortable on Ramp on CT and Lobby on T. So far, so good. FaZe 13-9  G2 Fragging and calling from Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen, as well as G2's economy being damaged by that 5v2, is what counts at the stretch and G2's streak ends at six. FaZe 8-9  G2 Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač saves the day to deny what could have been some classic G2 nonsense. Let's see if the economy damage matters. FaZe 7-8  G2 FaZe fly into B after a double kill but do not expect to find Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov on site, and get punished appropriately. A needed triple considering it's been a quiet game from the Russian thus far. FaZe 7-6  G2 G2 adapted to FaZe's position swap and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač is warming into the game. Ancient streak isn't over yet, even if Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa have just 10 kills between them. FaZe 7-2  G2 G2 have won six Ancients in a row but FaZe are in cruise control here. Part of that is down to Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard, who is now the B Anchor with Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen in Cave, shutting B down time and time again. He's 12-7 so far. FaZe 4-2  G2 Plenty of Deagle prowess in the server, but FaZe have survived the early force wars and have a two round lead. FaZe 1-1  G2 We wondered if Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen would try and surprise in the veto but it's G2 who do so instead. Inferno is G2's most picked map, and FaZe even lost 13-7 to Cloud9 on it yesterday, but they ban it in favor of their old permaban Mirage. Perhaps they were scared off by FaZe's 10-1 record on Inferno before that Cloud9 game, or threw Inferno-hater Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski a bone. Let's see how it goes. On the Cloud9 game:""It feels good to finally win a close game, there's been a lot of times recently where we haven't like we used to."" What made the difference: ""We've been working very hard, with extra emphasis on playing together as a unit instead of as separate players. When bad shit happens you get better as a team."" On G2: ""It's the same story as with Cloud9, they'll play very differently to the old G2. It's very important for our confidence to win."" Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi had a debut to forget against Natus Vincere, with 12 frags, 53 ADR, and a 0.56 rating. His BIG side will once again be the underdogs as they face Virtus.pro in the last game of the day. Liquid's opponents, Natus Vincere, absolutely smashed BIG in their opener. There was a steel to Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius and company as they seek to ward off the post-trophy hangover that hurt them after their Major victory. It helped, too, that Mihai ""iM"" Ivan was in BLAST.tv Paris Major form with a 1.71 rating. A replay including the final kill can be found here. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's stint as Liquid captain got off to a flyer, with a 2-0 win over Virtus.pro. There were promising signs from the new boys as Justin ""jks"" Savage earned 80 ADR on his first match since October 2023, and Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak came alive with several key multi-frags in overtime on Ancient. It's time for yet another FaZe-G2 bout. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač's side have now won four maps in a row against Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's stumbling superteam, but are yet to play them with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski. We should keep an eye on the veto: The new G2 have been able to ban both Vertigo and old permaban Mirage in series after series (playing Mirage just once, and Vertigo zero). Will karrigan deliver a curveball? Dessert is served first with a mouthwatering FaZe-G2 clash, and BIG-Virtus.pro get the primetime slot. Makes sense.",2-8-2024 00:40,1722552000000

It's a great boost for the current world No.44, who will return to a LAN event after missing the Copenhagen Major due to visa issues. Aleksandr ""shalfey"" Marenov, who replaced Denis ""seized"" Kostin on the team in June, played a key role in the team's qualifying campaign with a 1.25 rating, second only to Aleksandr ""glowiing"" Matsievich's 1.31. For Johnny Speeds, it was a bitter end to their hopes of an international LAN appearance. Ranked 52nd in the world, the Swedish side surpassed everyone's expectations in the qualifier, beating fnatic, Nemiga, Cloud9 and 3DMAX, but fell short in the decisive stage. The Swedish team performed well and came within inches of taking the series to a third map. However, they let a 12-10 lead slip on Mirage and then collapsed in overtime.

Live updates from BLAST Fall Groups day 6,https://www.hltv.org/news/39507/live-updates-from-blast-fall-groups-day-6,"Liquid have succeeded in replicating their success from just a few days ago, besting Natus Vincere in a hotly-contested three-map series to lay claim to a place in the BLAST Premier Fall Final. New addition Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak shined in particular on the decider of Inferno, as the Polish AWPer finished with a 1.66 rating on the map when his team needed him most. Natus Vincere 12-10  Liquid Natus Vincere 9-9  Liquid The daunting 9-3 lead that Natus Vincere entered the second half with, off the back of nine consecutive rounds, has been whittled down to nothing by Liquid, who have accrued six in a row of their own on the defense. Liquid now look poised to pull off a repeat win over Natus Vincere in Group D of the Fall Groups. Natus Vincere 9-5  Liquid Natus Vincere 9-3  Liquid Seems like Natus Vincere's players have taken a peek at their watches and realized it's midnight in Copenhagen, because they're now in a rush to bring this match to a close. Nine rounds in a row on the defense have now firmly planted Natus Vincere in the driver's seat, and a pistol round victory could be all that separates them from the Fall Final if Liquid continue to struggle to mount a response. Natus Vincere 5-3  Liquid Despite the early 0-3 start, Natus Vincere have found their composure on the defense, quickly accruing five rounds in a row thanks to solid holds like the one showcased in the clip below. Natus Vincere 1-3  Liquid Liquid have gotten off to a solid start in the Inferno decider, carving out three quick rounds thanks to a pistol round win. Natus Vincere are keen on keeping things close, however, as they answered back by laying claim to the first gun round of the map. Natus Vincere 14-16  Liquid After a strong T-side that saw Liquid recover from numerous man-disadvantage situations, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and co. have laid claim to Anubis with a 16-14 scoreline after enduring a tight overtime. The series is now set to be decided on Inferno, where Liquid took down Natus Vincere 13-11 just days ago. Natus Vincere 14-14  Liquid Natus Vincere 12-12  Liquid Forced onto a rough buy in the final round of regulation, Natus Vincere managed to find value out of an AWP saved by Mihai ""iM"" Ivan in the previous round, forcing overtime in the face of a fierce Liquid T-side. Natus Vincere 11-9  Liquid Natus Vincere 10-8  Liquid Liquid are fighting tooth and nail on their map pick of Anubis, responding to Natus Vincere's pistol round victory and subsequent conversion with a three-round streak of their own. Natus Vincere have since retorted with another round to put them into double-digits, but with Liquid only two rounds behind, this is still anyone's game. Natus Vincere 7-5  Liquid Natus Vincere 6-2  Liquid Natus Vincere 5-0  Liquid After an impressive 1v2 retake, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken seemed to have issues with his PC as he attempted to defuse the bomb, initially exclaiming that his game had crashed. Without a kit to his name, the defuse would have been unlikely anyway, but it would certainly have been close. Natus Vincere 1-0  Liquid Natus Vincere 13-9  Liquid After a dominant 10-2 half, things looked a little shaky to kick off the offense for Natus Vincere, as a lost pistol round soon segued into a 10-8 scoreline. A force-buy victory soon reignited things for Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen, allowing the European side to finish off their map pick with a 13-9 scoreline before heading to Anubis. Natus Vincere 11-7  Liquid Natus Vincere 10-5  Liquid Natus Vincere 10-2  Liquid Natus Vincere are not interested in losing this time around versus Liquid, allowing only two rounds to slip away after dominant CT-side performances from Mihai ""iM"" Ivan and Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov. With Nuke basically finished, Liquid may be thinking about what they can do to recover on Anubis, with an Inferno decider looking likely if they want to secure another win over the reigning Major champions. Natus Vincere 7-2  Liquid Natus Vincere 4-0  Liquid Natus Vincere's match versus Liquid has kicked off on Nuke, with the former side grabbing the first three rounds off the back of a pistol win. Things got a little hairy in round three, however, with Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius's grenade pull-out causing a scary situation for his side. Speaking to James ""BanKs"" Banks after the match, Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski admitted that the team lacked some focus today, which cost them some rounds in the series against Ninjas in Pyjamas. On the messy Inferno game: ""I would say we were not fully focused today like in other games. I feel like it was slipping through our fingers. But we stayed calm until the end. In the end, we had some good calls and some good plays."" On the team's good run of results: ""With the small amount of prep, we played really well. We maybe threw some rounds on Ancient. But even with the kind of mistakes we made, it was pretty okay. I didn't feel the pressure. As I said, we were playing at like 50% of our focus. I'm not taking anything from NIP, I think they played well. I just think we played more aggressively today. I'm also happy, it's going to be my first BLAST tournament."" On whether he is now enjoying playing B site on Inferno:  Sighs ""Yeah, yeah."" After some first-half blunders, G2 kept their composure on the CT side and made light work of their opponents to put the series to rest. G2 join Spirit and Vitality at the Fall Final, while Ninjas in Pyjamas will have another shot at qualification in a Play-In match against Astralis. G2 6-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas It seems that G2 got a little bit too comfortable and lost their focus towards the end of the half. It all started in that round where Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač was killed on B while planting because no one was covering him. Ninjas in Pyjamas were gifted a way back into the game, and they're making the most of it! G2 3-1  Ninjas in Pyjamas G2 carried their momentum into Inferno and are causing the NIP defense all sorts of headaches. They could have been up 4-0 if they hadn't lost a round to time after a late A execute. Ninjas in Pyjamas's late comeback attempt was not enough as G2 sealed victory in a round where they had only one gun and a bunch of Tec-9s to work with. A fantastic display from G2, who had the upper hand from the early exchanges, Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz had the most AWP kills in the game (10), but he could not cause the same impact that he had against FaZe on this map, where Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov  (1.80 rating) reigned supreme. Up next is Inferno. G2 8-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač's triple kill in the final round helped G2 to halt NIP's momentum. For a while there, the Ninjas were in full control, thanks to some great rounds from Max ""maxster"" Jansson, who ended the half with 13 frags. G2 6-1  Ninjas in Pyjamas G2's defense is looking solid on Ancient, and everyone is pulling their weight. Some of these rounds haven't been as clean as they would have liked, but they are getting out of tricky situations by out-aiming their opponents. After looking so strong on this map against FaZe, Ninjas in Pyjamas are having a hard time getting into their rhythm. One map down and facing a 0-7 deficit on Mirage, Vitality clawed things back to secure the map 13-10 and force the decider of Nuke. After battling back and forth throughout the first half, Vitality pieced together a firm defense in the decider, not dropping a single round in the second half in order to claim a 13-7 scoreline and earn a place in the Fall Final. Astralis will now have one more opportunity to reach the Fall Final, competing against the loser of G2 versus Ninjas in Pyjamas for a shot at competing in front of the home crowd in Copenhagen in September. Astralis 7-9  Vitality Astralis 7-5  Vitality Despite a poor buy to finish off the final round of the half, Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr managed to stave off Vitality even despite their team's meager weaponry. Astralis 3-4  Vitality Astralis 2-3  Vitality Astralis 10-13  Vitality Just five rounds away from the Fall Finals, Astralis struggled at the final hurdle, allowing a strong CT-side lead to slip away to a 7-5 half, and managing to scrape together just three rounds throughout their T-side. The series now moves to Nuke, where Vitality firmly bested Astralis in their previous meeting on the map earlier in the event 13-7. Astralis 10-12  Vitality Astralis 9-11  Vitality Astralis 7-7  Vitality After a tough start to Mirage, Vitality have shaken off the rust, recovering from a 0-7 start on T-side Mirage to piece together a 5-7 half. Bagging the pistol round and subsequent conversion, Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's men have tied things up in the blink of an eye, with the game now firmly up for grabs by either side. Astralis 7-3  Vitality After a truly dreadful start to Mirage, it seems that Vitality have finally found their footing on the T-side, albeit only narrowly avoiding a disaster on what proved to be their first round on their map pick. Astralis 5-0  Vitality A couple of strong B defenses by Astralis and especially their B anchor Alexander ""br0"" Bro, and Astralis are five rounds ahead. Astralis 13-10  Vitality A well polished performance on their map pick gives Astralis the lead in the series. They lost their BLAST Groups opening bout against Vitality 0-2 and picked Dust2 at the time, with their change to Vertigo paying off for  Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and company. Mirage is next on the menu. Astralis 8-8  Vitality Vertigo remains a slow-paced and tactical affair, with the scores tied at eight after Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi and William ""mezii"" Merriman turned a 2v3 situation. Astralis 7-5  Vitality Astralis took the first half despite Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's best efforts (14 kills and 110 ADR in numbers). Much of Astralis' success came on the B site, where William ""mezii"" Merriman was unable to hold back the hard-shooting Danes. Astralis 2-3  Vitality Four multikills in five rounds for Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut, and Vitality quickly negate Astralis' pistol-round victory. Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia joined James ""BanKs"" Banks for a quick post-match talk about their win against Complexity. On Dust2:  ""We felt like we weren't in the game. Sometimes it happens, and you have problems because of that. It was a bad performance by me especially."" On Nuke: ""There were a lot of strange rounds, we aren't in the best shape. There are a lot of stupid things happening on the server, it's not the best CS you have seen from us."" That sh1ro clutch was everything. Spirit were on the verge of the game slipping away until chopper stepped up with that spraydown (see below). Without it, Spirit would have had their money broken, but instead they went on a seven-round run, with sh1ro's clutch putting one of the final nails in Complexity's coffin. The favorites barely survive and secure the Fall Final. Complexity have another chance to qualify, and they'll play against another second-placed team tomorrow. Spirit 12-10  Complexity After five rounds in a row went against them Complexity were just about to break the run with a halfbuy win, until sh1ro broke their hearts with another clutch that rested on a knife's edge. Spirit 7-10  Complexity Spirit have been uncharacteristically sloppy in key situations and Complexity have always been there to punish their impatience to gain entry into open bombsites. It has still gone back and forth in the gunrounds, though, now thanks to a chopper quad-kill that might have just saved Spirit's bacon. Spirit 5-7  Complexity Spirit now have their work cut out for them after they gave up the 5-2 lead. hallzerk has come alive, now sitting on 14-5 after adding onto that 1v2 clutch in spades in the closing stages of the first half. They seemingly had the right read on Spirit every time with stacks on the lower bombsite whenever Spirit had the advantage. Spirit 5-4  Complexity That was an ill-advised peek from sh1ro, but hallzerk was there to punish the mistake and made sure Complexity are still in with a shot, because otherwise they'd have had to go on an eco. Spirit 1-1  Complexity Another pistol round conversion slips away from Complexity as sh1ro steps up with the Scout to win the forcebuy in the last second before time ran out. hallzerk has been up and down in this series and his body language hasn't impressed Bubzkji. Not the best idea to throw your mouse around, to be fair. Complexity broke the five-map streak on Dust2 and failed to do so up against eight in a row on Anubis from Spirit, and now a six-map streak on Nuke is up for grabs. Spirit haven't lost Nuke since late march, and they've beaten some teams who are no slouches on the map: Natus Vincere, FaZe and G2, among others. A forceful response from Spirit to the double-overtime loss on Dust2 as they extend their Anubis streak to nine in a row. It was competitive at first with Complexity making it 4-4, but Spirit ran away with the map after that without ever looking back. Grim ends the map on just three kills, but the individuals were lacking across the board with floppy the only one to put up some resistance. Spirit 8-4  Complexity The Spirit in-game leader sits on top of the board with 14 kills as the Russians put together a solid CT half. donk is up there with him but hasn't quite been as menacing of a presence as on Dust2. Not that he has needed to be. Spirit 4-4  Complexity zont1x has been having a rough time, now on 2-7 and 1-4 in opening duels, this time unable to trade sh1ro who got himself caught in mid-air, courtesy of floppy's double entry. Spirit 4-3  Complexity The teams are taking a little breather due to a technical issue on zont1x's side. So, a little update. Spirit ran away with three rounds after that second round blunder from Complexity, but since have been forced to save their double-AWP twice in a row after Complexity found entries on zont1x early in the rounds. Spirit 1-1  Complexity ""Holy shit,"" Henry ""HenryG"" Greer exclaims after that one. That's a tough one to swallow for Complexity, who were looking to get a good start on the CT side after the pistol win and instead fall behind. Complexity broke Spirit's five-map winning streak on Dust2, but now have an even taller task ahead of them on Anubis, where Spirit last lost in February and have since won eight in a row. Despite throwing away the chance to close it in first overtime, Complexity showed their mental fortitude after the tilting round and went flawless on the CT side to clinch the map in the second. Not even donk and sh1ro combining for 67 kills on that map was enough to stop EliGE and company. Spirit 15-15  Complexity EliGE is not going to forgive himself for that miss if Complexity end up losing this map. The players are understandably tilted after the 2v5 throw. Spirit 12-13  Complexity The in-game leader salvages a 1v3 attempt from zont1x to strike first in overtime. Spirit 12-12  Complexity After consecutive entries from EliGE got them to match point, Complexity missed out on a chance to close it out against some MP9s and pistols. Overtime it is. Spirit 11-11  Complexity This is turning into a highlight reel of a game. EliGE steps up to the plate with these three AK headshots: Spirit 11-10  Complexity Spirit 10-9  Complexity That was a monstrous spray from donk, and helps Spirit reclaim their lead after a resurgence in the gunrounds from Complexity. Spirit 9-5  Complexity It was looking so good for Complexity in the 5v5 retake on A, until it wasn't. Good lord, what was that shot on EliGE on short? Spirit 7-5  Complexity All in all a competitive half from Complexity considering they lost the pistol and subsequent two rounds. In the end, Spirit are ahead as they took advantage of some quick plays down B and up short, with Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets at the helm. It was beginning to get away from Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski's team as Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli kept finding himself picked off, but they limited the damage in the final round with Michael ""Grim"" Wince's aggressive MP9 push up Middle. Spirit 3-3  Complexity Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery has been left to his own devices on B in the first couple of gunrounds and stood the test to put his team on the board. Spirit 3-0  Complexity If you are above the age of 20, look away from the clip now. Some interesting memes have been exchanged in the text chat between Spirit and Complexity. In terms of the game, Spirit are up 3-0 after winning the pistol. Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks and vas a much happier figure after his team got a couple of wins under their belt. On Complexity's form: ""We have been playing a lot better since the OG game, things are flowing a lot better after some good practice."" On chances against Spirit: ""If we can play like we did against HEROIC, even if they had sAw, that's how you beat any good team. We have to be in that state and we can take on anyone."" It's not a matchup we see too often, but it's certainly not a pleasant one for the North American side, history shows. The two sides have met twice so far in Counter-Strike 2 and Spirit are 4-0 on maps and a combined 52-21 in rounds from their encounters at IEM Katowice earlier this year and the Thunderpick World Championship late last year, when Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov was yet to join the Russian side. Given Complexity's lackluster form of late on top of that, the favorite is clear as day. Though it was all for naught in the end, Emil ""Magisk"" Reif recorded his highest-rated map in Counter-Strike 2 in Falcons' series against Astralis yesterday. He put up a 1.85-rated performance in an overtime victory on Dust2 and went 27-4 in his team's round wins alone in the massive solo carry. Here are his five biggest highlights from that map: Round 1 - Magisk wins the pistol with a quad-kill Round 2 - Magisk salvages anti-force with a 1v2 Round 9 - Magisk clutches another 1v2 Round 13 - Magisk aces Astralis and laughs diabolically Round 28 - Magisk heimlich forces map point in OT The sixth day at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups will see four matches played for all the marbles as the victors will come away with a spot at the Fall Final, taking place in September in Copenhagen. The losers will have one last chance to grab a spot tomorrow. Here's the schedule for the day:",4-8-2024 00:33,1722724380000
Live updates from BLAST Fall Groups day 7,https://www.hltv.org/news/39518/live-updates-from-blast-fall-groups-day-7,"""I felt like I was a shadow of myself and not doing the plays I usually go for,"" a self-critical Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius said on X after NAVI's qualification bout against Complexity. ""Maybe it's a learning curve, maybe it's the format where you can lose 25 times and still qualify. Anyway, we qualified and that's all that matters. Cologne remains our priority."" All is well in the world as the three hot candidates for world's best player end the Fall Groups in the top five. Here's the list of the 10 highest-rated players of the last week: 1.  Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov - 1.49 rating2.  Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets - 1.453.  Emil ""Magisk"" Reif - 1.334.  Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov - 1.335.  Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut - 1.326.  Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov - 1.287.  Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi - 1.288.  Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač - 1.269.  Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač - 1.2610.  Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov - 1.26 All the event's leaderboards can be found here. After a week long Fall Groups, here are the six teams who earned their place at the BLAST Premier Fall Final, taking place at Forum Copenhagen in Denmark's capital city on September 25-29. The final two teams will come from the 16-team Showdown, played online from August 21-25. ""It's good that we got exposed here so that we can focus on Cologne,"" Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius said to James ""BanKs"" Banks on NAVI's Groups run, where they lost two series to Liquid. ""I think it was B1ad3's master plan all along. Play five games so we get the most practice and be ready for Cologne. Jokes aside, our mistakes got exposed and we can fix them."" NAVI do it on their second attempt after failing to convert a big lead against Liquid yesterday, and with that, we have the final team going through to the Fall Final through the groups. Meanwhile, Complexity go to the Showdown dejected — they had a big chance against Spirit yesterday and this was destined to be a three-mapper as well, but couldn't convert Anubis. Natus Vincere 10-5  Complexity NAVI had no business winning that round after Complexity got all the control they needed in a 5v3 on lower, but b1t found a way through a smoke to tear them apart and put NAVI on double digits. Natus Vincere 9-3  Complexity Ever so reliable, EliGE has been having a rough time on Nuke with just one kill throughout the whole half, and it's certainly playing on his mind judging by the replay cameras. Complexity have a mountain to climb now on the T side. Meanwhile, w0nderful, who was criticized on the desk for his lackluster Terrorist sides by Bubzkji, has led the charge with 13 kills and some big impact kills throughout the half. Natus Vincere 4-1  Complexity And thus ends NAVI's hot start on Nuke. That's one way to get on the board. Natus Vincere 13-11  Complexity After winning a halfbuy, NAVI nearly gave it away against pistols themselves, but pulled off the A retake in a 3v4 situation to close the map in the final round of regulation. Heartbreaking end for the North American side and EliGE especially, who played a great map in the loss. Natus Vincere 12-11  Complexity Back and forth rounds meant NAVI's economy was in the bin, but they made it work with w0nderful finding a couple of Deagle shots and b1t confirming the round in the clutch. Natus Vincere 10-9  Complexity It was nine in a row before Grim and EliGE picked up clutches for Complexity to finally stop the rot, and the game is back on. NAVI's economy on the back foot now after a relatively clean eco. Natus Vincere 7-6  Complexity And he doubles his kill count of the first half in just one round. Natus Vincere 6-6  Complexity NAVI salvaged the T half at the end with the round eight halfbuy win serving as the springboard. Aleksib took Complexity's best performer, EliGE, off the board in key entries, and b1t clutched a 1v1 later on the way to an even half. Natus Vincere 2-6  Complexity Out with the playbook, in with the A rush for Natus Vincere. The play netted them their second of the half thanks to Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius's double MAC-10 entry, but they need to build on that with a couple consecutive rounds. Natus Vincere 1-3  Complexity The American superstar is 8-0 after the first four rounds. Richard ""Xizt"" Landström gave a post-match comment on stream and reiterated the progress his team is making. On today's loss: ""On Inferno it felt like we stacked the right bombsites but we just didn't get the kills. Small details can change the game, and Astralis obviously played really well today."" On NIP's future: ""We can't get too greedy with how good we want to be results-wise. We're facing really good teams and we have some young players, and we just need some time and experience."" Where was the Ninjas in Pyjamas that took down FaZe? Astralis demolished the majority-Swedish side without breaking a sweat and booked their spot at their home Fall Final. Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz also had another anonymous map, and none of his teammates were able to pick up the slack. Astralis 7-2  Ninjas in Pyjamas Astralis 6-2  Ninjas in Pyjamas Ninjas in Pyjamas have gone missing in this series. The majority-Swedish squad has not troubled Astralis on either map, and Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz remains on anonymous on Inferno as well. Astralis 1-2  Ninjas in Pyjamas Ninjas in Pyjamas stacked the correct bombsite, but it wasn't enough as Astralis' apps attack threw a spanner in the works. Astralis 13-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas Their anti-eco woes didn't cost them in the end. Astralis got a comfortable 13-6 victory on Ninjas in Pyjamas's map pick, with Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz's 0.35-rated performance a big factor of their lackluster display. Astralis 10-5  Ninjas in Pyjamas A gift by Astralis gives Ninjas in Pyjamas a chance. The Danes walked into an A site and were bested by a few unarmored pistols. Astralis 6-3  Ninjas in Pyjamas The desk pointed out Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz as a win condition for Ninjas in Pyjamas, but he really hasn't gotten going yet. One kill and 35 ADR is all he has to show for himself after nine rounds. Astralis 0-2  Ninjas in Pyjamas He had a rough tournament so far, but Max ""maxster"" Jansson started the do-or-die series with a quad-kill in the pistol. Casper ""ruggah"" Due spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks ahead of their matchup against Ninjas in Pyjamas. On loss against Vitality: ""There was plenty of good and bad things, and when that happens, you don't beat a team like Vitality. We are moving in the right direction, we probably improved further than we thought back in March. I think some teams have better matchups against us, and Vitality are one of them."" On the pressure against NIP: ""It's competition, and at this level you need to handle these games. We're ready to go."" Astralis aim to make their home event after missing out on the Copenhagen Major earlier in the year. Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and company came second in the group after two losses to Vitality, with Ninjas in Pyjamas standing on the other side of the server. The majority-Swedish squad has surprised many in Copenhagen and took down Cloud9 and FaZe to finish second in the group. With Artem ""r1nkle"" Moroz leading the way for his team with a 1.17 average rating, it remains to be seen if any of his teammates can match him. Complexity have had a rough time in Copenhagen so far after starting their campaign with a loss against an Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov-less HEROIC, but have looked much better yesterday against Spirit. Natus Vincere have been equally hot and cold and lost to the new Liquid twice. The teams played each other twice this year, with each of them taking a series. The map record is also close at 3-2 in Natus Vincere's favor, but the bookies massively favor Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's troops this time around. The final day of the BLAST Premier Spring Groups will feature two do-or-die matches, with the winners set to receive a spot in the Fall Final, taking place in September in Copenhagen. The losers will be eliminated from contention and sent to the Showdown. Here's the schedule for the day:",4-8-2024 19:39,1722793140000
OG sign Chr1zN,https://www.hltv.org/news/39526/og-sign-chr1zn,"OG have once again turned to MOUZ NXT for reinforcements. OG has announced the signing of Christoffer ""Chr1zN"" Storgaard from MOUZ NXT, filling the roster spot that was left open by the departure of Nikita ""HeavyGod"" Martynenko to Cloud9 in July. Thomas ""Thomas"" Utting served as a stand-in for OG during their most-recent tournament appearance at BLAST Premier Fall Groups, but the Brit stated in interviews during the event that he never had any intention of joining OG permanently. Chr1zN will take up the IGL mantle for OG, as Nils ""k1to"" Gruhne surrendered the duty to take up the roles vacated by HeavyGod. Seventeen-year-old Chr1zN had been a part of MOUZ NXT since September 2022, averaging a 1.05 rating whilst leading the academy project. He oversaw several online event wins during his tenure, the most impressive coming in CCT North Europe Series 5, when Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo was still part of MOUZ NXT. This is not the first time OG have turned to MOUZ NXT for talent. OG signed Bram ""Nexius"" Campana from MOUZ's academy division late last year after the departures of Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković and Dion ""FASHR"" Derksen. Chr1zN briefly featured in a couple of tier-one online events mid-way through 2023, as he stood in for HEROIC after the drama involving Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller, Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard and Martin ""stavn"" Lund. The young Dane impressed during a run to top eight in Thunderpick World Championship, averaging a 1.12 rating. In OG, Chr1zN joins a struggling squad.

He got banned and Akros later confirmed this ban to be true."" GRID did not confirm the exact reason for the ban. This is not the first time joel has been embroiled in controversy, as the Swede was suspended by ESIC in August of last year due to suspected breaches of ESIC's anti-corruption code. The suspected breaches related to joel betting in matches in which he played and match-fixing. ESIC lifted joel's suspension in January 2024 due to finding no ""compelling or conclusive"" evidence of match-fixing. The organization stood by it's charges related to betting, but took into account joel's ""full and candid cooperation"" and ""genuine contrition and commitment to seeking professional help"" for gambling issues when ending his ban. HLTV contacted both Akros and BC.Game for a statement, but did not receive a response at the time of publishing.",4-8-2024 23:55,1722808500000
Woro2k to stand in for HEROIC at IEM Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39527/woro2k-to-stand-in-for-heroic-at-iem-cologne,"HEROIC have found their temporary degster replacement in the ex-Monte AWPer. HEROIC have announced that Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk will sub in for the team at IEM Cologne, set to start with the Play-In on August 7. The 22-year-old will replace Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov, who has once again been ruled out due to visa issues. Woro2k is most known for his time on Monte, who he represented since July 2022 before parting ways with the organization during this year's summer break. During his tenure, the team made an underdog run to the Paris Major quarter-finals, which saw them claim a top 10 spot in the world ranking. The announcement comes shortly after HEROIC officially confirmed degster will miss at least the start of IEM Cologne. ""Both degster and the organization did everything required; however, delays and other unforeseen circumstances occurred,"" HEROIC said. It is still unknown if degster will remain on the sidelines for the entire event, as HEROIC previously revealed to HLTV that they are still waiting for visa approval and are ready to fly him in immediately. HEROIC will start IEM Cologne in the Play-In stage against MIBR, with BetBoom and 9z also on their side of the bracket.

These have already been banned in most top competitions, including the ESL Pro Tour, which ESEA feeds into.

3DMAX to replace BetBoom at IEM Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39530/3dmax-to-replace-betboom-at-iem-cologne,"The Russian team is unable to travel to Germany because of visa issues. BetBoom will miss IEM Cologne 2024 due to visa issues, ESL announced Monday. Filling in for the Russian team at the showpiece event will be 3DMAX, per the ESL Pro Tour's Team Replacement Rules. BetBoom had earned a spot in the Play-In stage of IEM Cologne via the ESL World Ranking. IEM Cologne would have been the first tournament of the season for the Russian outfit, which hasn't played an official match since YaLLa Compass in June. BetBoom were set to attend the Skyesports Championship but withdrew from the tournament citing ""unmet promised conditions"" by the Indian tournament organizer, as well as fairness concerns. 3DMAX will take BetBoom's spot in the Play-In bracket, which will put them on a collision course with 9z in the first round of the double-elimination stage. The invitation comes as a major boost for the French team, who are riding a wave of confidence after winning the Skyesports Championship last month. Monday's ranking update saw them achieve their peak rank of 18th in the world. Slated to begin on August 7, the Play-In stage will feature 16 teams competing for eight spots in the group stage.

Team ranking: July 2024,https://www.hltv.org/news/39528/team-ranking-july-2024,"NAVI climb to top spot, FaZe drop out of the top five, and Liquid breach the top ten in the first team ranking of the new season. July marked the first month of the new season in Counter-Strike as the world's best teams returned from the tournament break for the Esports World Cup and BLAST Premier Fall Groups. There was also the Skyesports Championship LAN, and a myriad of online cups including the $100k RES Regional Series 6 that moved the dial of the top thirty of our ranking. For new readers or those in need of a refresher, here's a summary of how the HLTV World Ranking by 1xBet works. This is our first post since the May team ranking given the player break, but usually posts can be expected at the end of every month. Our team ranking is based on teams' achievements over the past year (with severe decay in points throughout each month), recent form over the last two months, and performance in recent events in the last 3 months. Each team is required to have a three-man core in order to retain their points. Online matches and tournaments are included, but with a diminishing factor which means they cannot make a big difference among the top teams, and mainly serve to put new teams on the map. Below is the current top 30 table as of Monday, August 5, which goes more in-depth into how the points are distributed — or you can check our special page, where you will be able to find the latest, weekly version of our ranking. You can see the lineup for each team by hovering over their name in the table. Natus Vincere may have been Major winners in March but the underdog winners never reached number one, something they have now achieved by claiming the Esports World Cup title to kick off the new season. ""A year ago we made a crucial decision: to switch to English and form a new team,"" Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy said on Twitter. ""It was a genuine challenge for us and fully transformed our development path. Yesterday, we reached the top of the HLTV rankings. Indescribable pride fills me for the work we've done."" The organization have not been top dogs since August 2022, when Natus Vincere still sported a Russian-speaking team with Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov, Ilya ""Perfecto"" Zalutskiy, and Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev. Just Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy remains from that lineup, and fittingly it was his MVP performance in Saudi Arabia that fired NAVI past G2 to win glory and get back on their perch as the best team in the game. It also dispelled fears of Natus Vincere resting on their laurels after the Major, as the team finally overcame their post-Copenhagen hangover (a decline that saw them drop to No. 6 in May) to return to trophy-winning form. Still, though, they are just four points clear of Spirit in second, who won BLAST Spring Final at the end of last season. NAVI need to do more to cement their grip on No. 1. Ever since they won IEM Sydney, FaZe have been a permanent fixture in the top five of Counter-Strike 2. Until now. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's men got off to a slow start in the new season with a quarter-final exit in Saudi Arabia and were banished to Fall Showdown by Ninjas in Pyjamas in Copenhagen. Those results were the final nail in the coffin of a team that have not seen a semi-final or final since they won IEM Chengdu in April. FaZe reached eight finals in a row before Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut ended that streak at ESL Pro League, and it seems the reality of that run — where FaZe won the first three finals but then lost four of the next five — is taking its toll on the roster. With IEM Cologne around the corner, they are officially in a slump. Liquid started the year at No. 48 after breaking up their core and signing Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken, Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller, and Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros in a statement of intent to start the year. Results, however, soured almost immediately and after failing to make the Major, the team never recovered. As cadiaN was isolated, Twistzz took more control, and the team did have improved showings at IEM Chengdu and ESL Pro League to take them to No. 11. But it took more changes, adding Justin ""jks"" Savage and Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak whilst making Twistzz IGL, to bring Liquid back into the top ten for the first time since July 2023. The new lineup have only played three series, but managed to snag two wins over No. 1 Natus Vincere and a third over No. 7 Virtus.pro to qualify for BLAST Fall Final and earn enough points to climb five places in the monthly ranking. Skyesports Champions 3DMAX did so by defeating The MongolZ, Aurora, and ENCE to complete an impressive run for the trophy. Their reward is a climb of nine places to No. 18 in the world, matching the core's peak from February 2022 when they still played as HEET. The Frenchmen were also given a chance to capitalize on that momentum after visa issues for BetBoom led to them securing an invite to IEM Cologne, where they will battle 9z in their opener. Aurora have also made it into the top 20, reaching a new zenith for both the core and the organization. The Russian squad made top four in India at Skyesports Championship and just before the break at ESL Challenger Jönköping and Nomadic Masters to confirm their status as dangerous underdogs on LAN as well as online. Sashi break into the top 30. Complexity fall out of the top ten. BetBoom and  FlyQuest drop out of the top 20. GamerLegion down to No. 32 after roster changes.",5-8-2024 20:28,1722882480000
Editoral: HLTV writers predict IEM Cologne surprises and disappointments,https://www.hltv.org/news/39517/editoral-hltv-writers-predict-iem-cologne-surprises-and-disappointments,"As we're heading into a wide-open IEM Cologne, HLTV writers share their predictions of the biggest surprises and disappointments to come from the iconic event. IEM Cologne begins on Wednesday with the first stage and the HLTV writing staff has come together for a round of predictions ahead of the event. With as many as six different names thrown around as contenders for the title and the world order changing with every tournament of late, it looks impossible to call who will be on the top step of the podium in a fortnight at IEM Cologne. So instead, our writing staff looked at the field to see who has the potential to throw up a surprise and which of the bigger names in conversation for a deep run could be in for a rough ride, and picked out one team for each of the two categories: NER0's pick to surprise:  Natus Vincere It's strange to pick the world No. 1 as a team ready to surprise, but there are still plenty of doubts in the community around the team that 'fluked' the Major and lost twice to Liquid at Fall Groups. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy and Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov have elevated their level to 1.15+ rating players at the start of the new season, and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan has finally found a way to frag from his roles. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy, even when those individuals are quiet, can find a way to win. Add in a favorable seed that means they only need to beat a low-ranked play-in team and Astralis for playoffs (where the arena will elevate Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius as always), and we could be on our way to a third 'fluke' of the year. NER0's pick to disappoint:  Astralis I'm putting a lot of eggs in the likely Natus Vincere-Astralis Group A upper bracket semi-final, but there's a reason. Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz taking over in-game leadership was a risk that initially seemed to be paying off, returning Martin ""stavn"" Lund to all his favored roles and giving him plenty of tactical responsibility as results trended upwards. But the similarities to that old HEROIC team don't end in the tactics. They have now suffered crushing upset losses to The MongolZ in Abu Dhabi and Virtus.pro in London that killed the honeymoon cold. They are a good team, but short of the map pool (greatly missing Overpass, and struggling on Dust2) to challenge NAVI and lack the individuals to challenge G2 and Spirit. An early exit is not out of the question. Lucas' pick to surprise:  9z 9z already surprised everyone at the end of the Spring season when they beat MOUZ, Liquid, and Vitality on the way to a semi-final finish at IEM Dallas. Then they beat KOI and fnatic at the FiReLEAGUE Global Finals to win the tournament, which shot them up to 12th place in the world ranking. On top of that, they moved from South America to Europe over the summer in order to continue their development. The decision to go with them as a surprise is not so much because I think that they will be better than their current spot in the ranking or that they will peak higher than their semi-final finish in Dallas, but because I think they can keep showing that their good results weren't a fluke and continue to compete with the best teams in the world at an event of the stature of IEM Cologne instead of disappearing back into the depths. Lucas' pick to disappoint:  FaZe FaZe defined the early days of CS2 by winning four titles and reaching seven grand finals, but after losses to Natus Vincere, G2, and Ninjas in Pyjamas since returning from the summer break, FaZe haven't hit the ground running after a slow end to the Spring season, which they ended with four losses in five games — and their only victory was against SAW. ""I think, most of all, we need to wake up and look at ourselves in the mirror. It comes down to everyone pushing through. It's a mental battle now, which we used to be good at, but sometimes things change,"" Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen said after FaZe was eliminated from the BLAST Premier Fall Groups. If any team can win that mental battle and go on to find redemption in the cathedral, I would bet on FaZe to be that team, but sometimes things change. Sumljiv's pick to surprise:  BIG BIG struggled with firepower for a long time, and the summer addition of Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi adds exactly that. While he had a rough debut tournament at BLAST Groups, he showed glimpses of his potential in the loss against Natus Vincere, where he was far and away the best player on the team. Another positive was Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische's form in their win against Virtus.pro in Copenhagen. Whether he can keep that up remains to be seen, but the optimist in me says he is slowly but surely turning a corner. BIG are also the home-town team that is no stranger to a Cinderella run in Cologne, and a positive result would be a sight for sore eyes after their recent struggles. Their play-in bracket pits them against FlyQuest, The MongolZ and SAW, which gives them a solid chance of progression, with the main event always throwing up a surprise or two — and it might just be BIG's turn again. Sumljiv's pick to disappoint:  Virtus.pro After Virtus.pro completed the blockbuster move for Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov, expectations were high straight out of the gate. The addition of the Russian superstar had a profound impact on the team's playstyle, however, which meant the team was often caught in two minds and prompted the organization to swap out long-time coach Dastan ""dastan"" Akbayev for Andrey ""Xoma"" Mironenko. In an interview with HLTV at the Esports World Cup, electroNic said that the team is starting to feel their game, but results at the EWC and BLAST Fall Groups haven't backed up his claims. VP will start their Cologne campaign at the main event and already have MOUZ, Vitality and FaZe in their group, and it is tough to see how they could contend for a playoff spot in such a stacked bracket. In addition, electroNic's individual form remains a worry. The Russian rifler is averaging a 1.03 rating across his tenure in the team, which is looking increasingly similar to his ill-fated Cloud9 stint. MIRAA's pick to surprise:  paiN Given 9z's lack of match time since the end of the last season, I'm going to go with paiN on this one. Everyone remembers just how well they did at the Copenhagen Major, where they were one victory away from reaching the playoffs and lost to eventual winners Natus Vincere in the 2-2 pool. Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt's billing as one of the best in-game leaders in Brazil will be put to the test in the first round of the play-in as they will go up against the new-look Liquid. paiN are on a 14-match winning streak in South America, and I'm looking forward to seeing João ""snow"" Vinicius in action against international opposition. MIRAA's pick to disappoint:  Natus Vincere FaZe and Vitality are obvious picks here given their recent struggles, so I'm going with Natus Vincere, who come off a disappointing showing at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups. Yes, they qualified for the Fall Final in the end, but they looked sluggish and off the pace in some moments and had to beat BIG and Complexity — hardly the toughest challenges. Time and time again, Natus Vincere's players and head coach B1ad3 have highlighted the importance of bootcamps to steer the ship back on course. Only a few days separate the Fall Groups and IEM Cologne, so questions need to be asked about their preparation for the German event. Natus Vincere have a worrying tendency to blow hot and cold, and reaching the semi-finals from their group will be extremely hard, considering that G2 and their nemesis, Spirit, are on the opposite side of the bracket. Another key issue for Natus Vincere is the lack of depth of their map pool. Outside of Mirage and Nuke, it's hard to know what they're comfortable on, and this could land them in trouble if either map is banned. Dempz's pick to surprise:  BIG BIG just brought onboard rigoN in what is a significant upgrade to their squad on paper, and in only their second official with the ex-Guild Eagles rifler, they took down the No. 7 team in the world, Virtus.pro. Not a bad return for a team that only recently struggled badly against sub-top opposition at YaLLa Compass. In said series against Virtus.pro, BIG had plenty going for them. syrsoN was impactful on the AWP throughout, something that has not been a guarantee since he returned to the fold. Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa was a consistent performer, but didn't have to pop off. Jon ""JDC"" de Castro had an absolute baller map in the decider. BIG played three good T-sides, and were a shade unlucky not to run it back to earn overtime on Mirage. I'm not just hanging my hat on a single BO3, as I realize BIG got spanked twice by Natus Vincere (who are the No. 1 ranked team in the world, by the way). If BIG can hit their peak form across all their players, they are a force to be reckoned with, and if there is any time they are going to hit that form, it's at their home event. Don't sleep on BIG, because they're making a playoff run in Cologne. Dempz's pick to disappoint:  MOUZ MOUZ put together a hot streak last season which saw them bag a second-place finish and back-to-back tournament wins, only to flop at IEM Dallas to end things with a whimper. Their return from the player break at Esports World Cup was none too convincing either, with MOUZ dropping maps to FURIA and Sashi before being comfortably dispatched by Natus Vincere. Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman and Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás were both relatively quiet in Dallas and Riyadh, and that is the main point of concern. That duo is the backbone of MOUZ, both aggressive players who shine in creating space and openings for themselves and the rest of the squad to thrive. Ludvig ""Brollan"" Brolin and Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo, considering their roles, can't be expected to carry MOUZ deep in tournaments, and they were the best performers at IEM Dallas and EWC respectively. The other factor to consider is this: IEM Cologne is a prestigious arena LAN, and that is where MOUZ have struggled to translate their considerable potential into tangible success. It should also be expected that MOUZ have one eye on the Major later this year, and will be planning their season to peak at that time, rather than now. All of the factors above taken into consideration, and I fear that MOUZ will at absolute best manage a playoff showing in Cologne, when considering their position as the No. 3 ranked team and their potential, they should be challenging for the trophy. Draik's pick to surprise:  9z With the wind in their sails after a strong finish to the first half of the season, 9z head into Cologne as solid candidates to break through the play-in, while also offering the potential to contend with the fiercer competition in the main stage. Having spent nearly a month in Europe since the player break drew to a close, the young Latin American squad should be both prepared and hungry for what is set to be their biggest test yet. Draik's pick to disappoint:  Complexity Although Complexity managed to redeem the end of the first half of 2024 with a win at ESL Challenger Jonkoping, the North American side seems to have resumed their slide into mediocrity now that the player break has come to a close. Given a gift in the form of an opening game versus ALTERNATE aTTaX, Complexity could still very well fall short in the play-in, slated to face either Falcons or Eternal Fire in their subsequent game. Should Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou’s men make their way past the play-in, one would still be hard-pressed to dream up a scenario where Complexity depart Cologne with a result worth writing home about considering the quality of opposition in attendance, a disappointment considering the glimpses of impressive form that the team displayed in the not-so-distant past. stich's pick to surprise:  9z The very nature of the question of a team that surprises almost presupposes an underdog team coming from the Cologne play-in stage — or maybe that's just my inherent gambler's addiction talking. There are a couple of candidates to go long on in the surprise department. All the Brazilian play-in teams could do damage as their region has shown promising signs of a resurgence this year. For NA, both Complexity and Liquid cannot be counted out and could easily make quarter-finals at minimum if they lock in. But I'm giving this one to 9z. The rise of the South American mix into the top 10 is not yet finished this year, and they could very well catapult off their IEM Dallas success with another strong performance. It is at the least undeniable that this team is one that will come well prepared into the play-in and likely do their proper homework on every opponent going into the fight. The inchoate nature of CS2 is such that many teams that were not in the conversation previously can string upsets and rise in the ranks quickly. Call it just ""vibes,"" but this is how I'm feeling on 9z. ¡Venga!, 9ziñeros! stich's pick to disappoint:  Natus Vincere There are a couple deflated contenders that would do well here. Personally, FaZe, Astralis, and MOUZ come most to mind. However, an opinion writer lives and dies by their schizotypal sword of unfettered writing freedom, and thus a hot take is in order. Natus Vincere, the world's current number one ranked team, will disappoint in Cologne. Their path to victory in the Esports World Cup was over various teams with their own current instabilities at play. And when you are called the world's number one team, expect everyone else to be gunning for your crown and anti-stratting you into oblivion. Striker's pick to surprise:  HEROIC HEROIC have had the beginning of the new season put on a damper after it turned out that Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov would miss the BLAST Premier Fall Groups and at the very least the beginning of IEM Cologne. But unlike in Copenhagen, the team now has a real stand-in — sorry, Eetu ""sAw"" Saha — lined up for Cologne. Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk will play with them until (if at all) degster can come in, which will give the European side a real fighting chance. The former Monte AWPer obviously won't be entirely up to date with HEROIC's playstyle and his role in it, but is arguably a more proven player in Counter-Strike 2 than degster and can have the same play-making flair, making him a worthy replacement. He'll also be hungry to show his worth after his benching, and, who knows, maybe even treat this as a potential job interview for HEROIC if degster's issues continue or he doesn't prove his mettle long term. Striker's pick to disappoint:  FaZe Food for thought: If everyone expects you to fail, is it even a disappointment? Such is the position FaZe find themselves in after their downturn at the end of the last season gave way to a rough beginning to the new season. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and the solution doesn't appear as simple as Robin ""ropz"" Kool getting out of a slump, even if he is the main player in the crosshairs at the moment. The 'FaZe bullshit' machine seems to have run out of steam as karrigan and company have not beaten a top-five team in three months now, and have struggled against teams they would have previously shrugged off, like Ninjas in Pyjamas in their latest loss at the Fall Groups and FlyQuest in their seasonal opener at the Esports World Cup. This is not a resumé you want heading into the biggest event of the season outside of the Major, and it puts FaZe at the bottom of an unusually big pile of realistic contenders for the title.",5-8-2024 22:08,1722888480000
First look: How did new teams fare ahead of IEM Cologne?,https://www.hltv.org/news/39531/first-look-how-did-new-teams-fare-ahead-of-iem-cologne,"We take a first look at G2, Liquid, and all the other teams flying to Germany with new players in their ranks. Summer 2024 may not have had the blockbuster moves of winter earlier this year, but there was still plenty of flux as G2, Liquid, and more rolled the dice on roster swaps. IEM Cologne, with its July slot in the calendar, is the first test of their mettle at a truly elite level tier one event. It's the third biggest event of the year, with prestige in buckets and all 16 of the top 16 teams in our ranking attending. It's what teams like MOUZ and Spirit have been practicing for as they ease into the season. New teams are at a crossroads: Do they have the advantage, based on an ability to surprise, or a disadvantage in not knowing how they will respond in the highest of stakes? We found that most teams peak within three months of their foundation. As much as teams request time from fans (and management), hitting the ground running is absolutely essential. A strong IEM Cologne for these teams would do just that, but who is best placed? Let's find out. First up are G2, Esports World Cup finalists and No. 5 in the world. The new Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski-led roster has a 12-4 record in maps and has lost just one series, that Esports World Cup final to Natus Vincere. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, despite some discomfort in his new roles (and he has plenty of those), has provided the firepower spark G2 have lacked in Counter-Strike 2. He's pretty much slotted in one-for-one in place of Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković on most maps (especially on CT), but has a 1.13 rating compared to nexa's 0.92 — a huge difference. His dynamism is also a huge boon for G2, who now have a player used to being a star opener available in late-round situations when he is lurking in spots like Lobby on Nuke or Boiler on Inferno. Even if opener No. 1 (Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač) dies, malbsMd can just run in and blow your head off in the 3on3. He will need time to fully adjust to his new anchor roles, and as people study his tendencies it is not a guarantee he can maintain his impressive level in spots where most players drop below 1.05 ratings. But, as people have discovered with Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets, technical ability can outweigh any level of preparation. malbsMd is so good that you do wonder at times when watching G2 if they should make him more involved. He can have some quiet halves where action simply does not come his way. But there are very few third stars who shoot as hard as the Guetamalan, and he has made no complaints about his new position. So far, the gamble is paying off. The other benefit of change is that it lights a fire in the belly of existing players, with Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač going from a 1.04 rating at the start of the year to a 1.11 in his first two events this season. NiKo started trending up at IEM Dallas and has maintained that with the new roster, even outperforming the still excellent Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov. It is now on in-game leader Snax to prove that this is a concrete improvement and not a honeymoon buoyed by individual quality. There needs to be tactical layers to G2's game, something you would not always associate with Snax's GamerLegion. Like Rasmus ""HooXi"" Nielsen, he will get no credit when they win, and all the blame when they lose — but win enough trophies, and who would care? The new Liquid also hit the ground running by winning their BLAST Fall group and beating world No. 1 Natus Vincere twice. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's transition to in-game leader was an ""inevitable"" one if you ask the man himself, and the 24-year-old couldn't have asked for a better start. Key tactical partner Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis, who built much of Liquid's stratbook with Twistzz even when Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller was still in the lineup, has not enjoyed a huNter--esque renaissance but did show signs of his qualities at times, especially on T side (1.14 rating). In this lineup, too, YEKINDAR only needs to be an X-factor with Twistzz and Keith ""NAF"" Markovic taking charge and promising signs from rookie AWPer Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak. ultimate was the big gamble, a move initiated by Twistzz himself, and still has some rough spots to iron out of his game. Liquid, though, need to be careful how they do so — the whole point of signing ultimate was to find a low-cost ""aggressive AWPer that has a kind of flash to them."" Errors are common in that playstyle, but the rewards can be huge. You already saw that reward as ultimate took over in overtime on Ancient against Virtus.pro and on Inferno against Natus Vincere, a level cadiaN rarely hit in CS2. ultimate has 0.14 opening kills per round in Liquid colors, 0.05 above cadiaN's 0.09, and a whopping 0.11 of those came with a sniper (cadiaN had just 0.05). That's an extra AWP pick in 6% of rounds, something that hugely increases round win probabilities. Justin ""jks"" Savage is the other new man, but does not have a spotlight on his level. With NAF as the star lurker, jks' job is just to be solid, similar to his G2 level, and provide some experience in arena games. The Australian lurker was a fairly poor fragger on debut, at 0.56 per round (about 13 frags in a full match) and 64 ADR, but deserves an excuse given it was his first officials since October 2023. There is not huge upside to his signing compared to a born-and-bred CS2 zoomer but Liquid did not want that risk: jks is a known quantity, and doing his job. As a team, then, the balance is there. Star in-game leaders are not common for a reason, and Twistzz is fighting precedent by hitting such high ratings in what appears to be a functional, happy, team. But he is no Benjamin ""blameF"" Bremer: When Twistzz calls around himself, you are unlikely to meet much resistance or complaints of selfishness. It is an experiment, but so far, so good. FURIA made two big changes, swapping Andrei ""arT"" Piovezan (via Kayke ""kye"" Bertolucci) for Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros and replacing long-time coach Nicholas ""guerri"" Nogueira with his assistant Sid ""sidde"" Macedo. But they also added former FaZe analyst Viacheslav ""innersh1ne"" Britvin and former Liquid man Hunter ""Lucid"" Tucker as they look to evolve their game and keep up with the European tier-one meta. The new roster has a very similar structure to Liquid: Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato is the star lurker like NAF, with skullz as a more supportive one like jks. Then, we have Marcelo ""chelo"" Cespedes as the YEKINDAR-esque entry, Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos roaming and trading like Twistzz, and  Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo as the AWPer. skullz and KSCERATO are both players that largely want to do the same thing, liking to lurk and conserve their health for the late round. But with a clear hierarchy in favor of KSCERATO, it should not affect the balance too much with Brazil's best player clearly prioritized in CT star positions (Conn Mirage, Middle Ancient, Door Nuke) and often playing with skullz as a bomb-site partner. It's clear who will be baited in, and who will be throwing the flashbangs. The difference to Liquid is that FURIA are keeping their low-fragging AWPer IGL FalleN instead of an ultimate-like gamble. This puts more emphasis on the rifles — particularly yuurih, whose form has dropped off as of late but enjoyed a 1.17 rating in the new roster's debut at EWC. That debut was interesting to see the roles and general style, but fairly limiting as a sample due to the format: FURIA played Nuke in all three of their lower bracket best-of-ones (five of their total of eight maps), and were defeated by Natus Vincere and MOUZ in the only best-of-threes they played. That means we should not read deeply into yuurih's uptick, or skullz and chelo's struggles, but the huge changes to the coaching staff prove FURIA are a team to watch. Firepower may still hold them back, with Brazilian talent like Felipe ""insani"" Yuji and Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt all spread out on different teams, but at least they are trying. It is three months since Imperial placed second at GET Rio, and more than that since they made it to the top 16 of PGL Major Copenhagen. In that time they performed poorly at both LANs they attended (ESL Pro League and FiReLEAGUE Finals) and subsequently removed Henrique ""HEN1"" Teles for Santino ""try"" Rigal. The new lineup has only played qualifiers and ESL Challenger League but have been in good form with try on a team-high 1.21 rating. IEM Cologne will be a different beast, an arena where HEN1 was often a game-winning force even if his overall ratings still lagged behind his 2017-2020 standards. Rafael ""zakk"" Fernandes and Vinicius ""VINI"" Figueiredo deserve credit for turning Imperial from a nostalgia-ridden retirement home into a forward facing organization with great young talent in the form of anchor Lucas ""decenty"" Bacelar, opener Kaiky ""noway"" Santos, and now AWPer try. Like all Brazilian teams, you do wish all of this talent was consolidated onto one or two rosters, but in a world of astronomical buyouts Imperial have done an impressive job of teambuilding. By benching HEN1, too, they proved they could be bold: We'll now have to wait and see if it pans out. paiN spent a good four weeks top of Brazil's ranking in May, but were forced into a roster change after failing to turn Vinicius ""n1ssim"" Pereira's loan move from Sharks into a permanent deal. They won GET Rio over Imperial with academy graduate Marcelo ""nyezin"" Ramos standing in, but took a punt on a far more exciting (and more risky) prospect as their permanent fifth: João ""snow"" Vinicius. snow, who is just 17-years-old, signed for Case when he was 15 and averaged a 1.11 rating there as their most aggressive piece. He had star roles on both sides of the map, 25% opening attempts, and earned his chance on a top team by steadily improving to the point where he was a 1.19 rating player on CS2. The problem for paiN is that they were looking for a passive, supportive, anchor-lurker rather than an aggressive star. But such was snow's talent, they pursued him anyway. snow has now played 112 maps in these new roles, starting slowly but is now on a six-event streak above a 1.06 rating and scores highly in both KAST (75%) and clutches (19-10 W-L in 1on1s, 36 clutches overall). paiN might have been inspired by Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo, who was a star for MOUZ NXT but has developed into a leading candidate for 2024's Anchor of the Year. Roles, when a player is so young, are not the be-all-and-end-all. There is still risk at play, with snow yet to play an international LAN of this size, but paiN are always a threat with biguzera at the helm. Write them off at your peril. Home team BIG made waves when they signed Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische and Jon ""JDC"" de Castro from 00NATION, securing two of the best German players and returning to their native tongue for communication. With results still fairly middling, they have rolled the dice again and landed on Swiss rifler Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi to replace David ""prosus"" Hesse as the aggressive lurker. ""rigoN is definitely a very experienced player and he can decide rounds with his feel for the game,"" coach Alexander ""kakafu"" Szymanczyk told BIG's website. ""His aggressiveness also plays a decisive role and is one of the reasons why we brought him to BIG. We want him to be our 'X-factor' and thus be able to win rounds for the team."" That didn't go great at BLAST Fall Groups on debut, where rigoN had a 0.82 rating in three series. That sample, however, does not paint the true picture: BIG lost twice to Natus Vincere, but actually performed above expectations against Virtus.pro by beating the Russians, even if rigoN still found proceedings difficult. Playing well for BIG is not something that happens overnight. rigoN is used to speaking Kosovar and playing in Bad News Eagles, the complete opposite of BIG stylistically. He hasn't spoken German on a team since 2018. It is far too early to write him off. A bright spot, despite results, has been JDC, who has a 1.10 rating and 0.12 opening kills per round in BIG colors. This is a wildly different player to the supportive anchor JDC we saw in MOUZ, and is forming a dangerous one-two punch with stable-as-ever anchor-lurker Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa, and is a needed presence given the age (and reduction in fragging) of Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz. The big question mark is syrsoN. The sniper, who reached No. 10 in the COVID-affected online top 20 of 2020, has a 0.99 rating for BIG since he joined alongside JDC and has rarely made his influence felt in the server. Tobias ""tow b"" Herberhold, the coach that extracted that form out of syrsoN as BIG's coach in 2019-2021, has returned to the organization as a performance coach and will be key in trying to get the AWPer back to his best. To upset at IEM Cologne, they'll need far more than a 0.99.",5-8-2024 23:51,1722894660000
"As the keyboard debate continues, tournament organizers say 'Play on'",https://www.hltv.org/news/39532/as-the-keyboard-debate-continues-tournament-organizers-say-play-on,"Input-assist tools have begun to take over the CS scene, and no one is sure what will happen. Rarely before has a simple keyboard firmware update taken up so much of the public conversation in the Counter-Strike scene. Over the last weeks, content creators, analysts, a select group of professional players (more on this later), and the community at large have engaged in a fierce debate about the in-game advantages that Razer's Snap Tap and Wooting's SOCD (Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions) can provide and whether they should be outright banned in esports. Razer took the competitive gaming world by storm on July 9 with the release of Snap Tap for its Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards. The feature lets the keyboard prioritize the latest input between two selected keys, allowing for more accurate counter-strafing in FPS games like Counter-Strike 2, and eliminating human error. In essence, it does the same as null-binds but on a hardware level. Null-binds are key bindings created with console commands that allow players to disable multiple key inputs at the same time. They have long been a controversial topic in movement game modes like KZ and Surf and are banned in tournaments. A few days later, Wooting announced the release of the beta version of Rappy Snappy — a feature long in development that takes advantage of its keyboards' Hall Effect sensors. In a post on X addressing ""cheating concerns,"" Wooting stressed that Rappy Snappy ""is not the same"" as Razer's Snap Tap, explaining that, rather than prioritize the last-pressed key, it monitors user intention by comparing how far down two keys are pressed. ""We believe SOCD should be managed by the game, not the device, so that everyone is on a level playing field,"" Wooting added. However, the Dutch company quickly realized it was shouting into the wind, so it created a poll asking if it should introduce a feature identical to Snap Tap. And the results were clear. Forced to put ideologies aside, lest Razer would gain a significant advantage in this keyboard battle, Wooting resigned itself to making SOCD available on all its keyboards. ""If it's allowed, you need it,"" the company wrote. ""We are gamers foremost and think building SOCD into keyboards is a bad development,"" Max Janssen, Partnership Manager at Wooting, told HLTV. ""We would have never thought this would be allowed because of the impact it can have on games. ""We built Rappy Snappy because it improves your accuracy by a very marginal amount. We thought of SOCD in the past but right away didn’t want to put any further action into it because it was very clear this shouldn’t be a thing. We have always been for improving people's hardware as much as is legally allowed."" Opinions on just how powerful Snap Tap and SOCD vary greatly. ""Razer’s new keyboard is basically cheating,"" claimed YouTuber optimum. More recently, YouTuber and analyst Donald ""Voo"" Parkhurst released a video on this topic explaining why he believes that Snap Tap is ""worse than you think."" But the consensus seems to be that there are no downsides to using these features, and that the advantages they provide, however marginal, can make a difference in the game. ""If you're a pro and Snap Tap is allowed on the highest level, you'll definitely want to use it,"" said YouTuber MrMaxim. ""It pretty much only comes with benefits."" The same opinion has been expressed by Chad ""SPUNJ"" Burchill. ""If it's allowed, you're better off having this than not having this,"" the Australian caster said on a recent episode of the 'Talking Counter' podcast. ""If these players can get their hands on one of these keyboards, they definitely should. I don't know why you wouldn't. It is going to give you an edge."" I learned about Snap Tap days right after IEM Dallas. The North American tournament was one of the first tier-one competitions where players were using Razer's feature, even though it had not been released or even announced. I couldn't help but imagine a world where some teams can have a competitive advantage simply by having a good rapport with a peripheral company or being sponsored by one. (MOUZ, who are sponsored by Razer, denied having used Snap Tap during their ESL Pro League 19 run. Some of the team's players, the organization added, tested the feature for the first time after being eliminated in Dallas.) HLTV asked two professional players to test Snap Tap before it was released to the public. (Razer granted us early access to the feature for this article.) One of the players requested anonymity. Below you can find their thoughts: Player 1: ""In a normal keyboard, I can never do the same perfect strafe consistently. And there is a delay in the response from the game/keyboard. What I immediately felt with this was that strafing was consistent and the movement was cleaner, like in CS:GO. Strafing is more consistent because you no longer have the feeling that you're sliding when you're counter-strafing. And, of course, the response is immediate when you press the key."" Sebastian ""beastik"" Daňo: ""The advantages are brutal, you can feel a big difference and it really feels like CS:GO movement. But considering I read that these are pretty much the movement aliases that are banned at tournaments, it doesn't make sense to me that this would be allowed, and they should ban it, in my opinion. It's an extreme advantage in tier one."" beastik is part of a minority of players who have publicly expressed concern about the impact of these input-boosting tools. The most vocal member of the group is FaZe star Robin ""ropz"" Kool, who wrote on X in response to Snap Tap's release that the feature ""should not be allowed"" in tournaments. ""I come from a 1.6 KZ background where null-binds are strictly forbidden and most people I’ve talked to agree that this new keyboard technology gives an unfair advantage,"" he told HLTV about Snap Tap. ""The fact of the matter is it’s essentially a macro / built-in script, which does two actions at once and automates a core aspect of the game that has a major impact on all movement inputs. ""In other words, when you move with A, then press D, it automatically releases A, so overlapping your peek or strafe is impossible, it doesn’t care when you lift your finger off A. Overlapping keys would cause a loss in momentum and is completely normal for everyone. However, this technology or null-binds would create 100% long-term strafe accuracy with zero overlaps, which should be impossible because, in the end, there will always be human error. ""In competitive CS matches, the skill differences will be lost and everyone could make world-class peeks, shoulder-peeks and counter-strafes. On average, the peeks will be faster, the counter-strafes will be faster and therefore the moment to shoot will come faster, while the skill level goes down. ""In movement modes, it gets more complicated but uses the same basics. It could make a difference in a world record, where the competition is down to milliseconds or millimeters (units). ""Null-binds in CS have existed for almost 20 years and it is clear what they do. There are no disadvantages to it, it just corrects movement mistakes. Either null-bind keyboard technology should be simply forbidden or allow these scripts to be used in configs. I recommend option one."" Razer did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but a company representative told HLTV that at the recent BLAST Premier Fall Groups, 36% of players were using the Huntsman V3 Pro. That figure could not be independently confirmed, and it's worth noting that some players might be using the keyboard without Snap Tap. They also said that some of the other players at the event were testing the keyboard. Wooting has also enjoyed a rise in popularity among gamers since the release of Rappy Snappy and SOCD. ""The interest has definitely spiked a lot,"" Janssen said. ""Our sales went through the roof the last couple of weeks. ""We have had many tier-one CS pros pre-order the 80HE. A lot of them have reached out to us to try a 60 HE+ or the Two HE. You can expect an increase in Wooting keyboards in Cologne."" HLTV knows that ESL has told players that all keyboards and mice are allowed in its tournaments. It began to keep track of the peripherals used in events only at the Esports World Cup. BLAST told HLTV that it doesn't keep a record of what players use. This is a convoluted situation, made all the more complex by how fragmented the Counter-Strike ecosystem is, with multiple tournament organizers, each with its own rules and systems in place, and third-party matchmaking services. The lack of a unified response has only added to the confusion. At the end of July, FACEIT clarified that null binds, while allowed in normal FACEIT games, had been banned from ESEA matches, which follow the ESL Pro Tour rulebook, even though anyone using Snap Tap or SOCD can effortlessly achieve the same result. ""I'd recommend holding off purchasing a Razer keyboard in case this changes,"" FACEIT Community Manager 'Darwin' wrote on Reddit on July 23. Many players have begun using Snap Tap and SOCD in events, yet you will be hard-pressed to find public endorsements of these features from pros. That's because these tools fall into a gray area that no one knows exactly how to deal with, and there's still a chance that they will be banned in the future. As a pro player, there's no upside to publicly backing these features: you risk facing ridicule if one day they are stripped away from you. For some players, there's also the issue of playing with a keyboard from a sponsor's competing company. While most teams give players free rein to use the keyboard of their choosing, regardless of the hardware maker, there are some rare cases where players must use gear provided by a peripheral partner. As things stand right now, a ban on these input-assist tools will most likely have to come from Valve. HLTV knows that the developer is aware of these features but has not yet made a public stance. And tournament organizers certainly don't want to be the ones poking into the hornet's nest, leaving the whole scene in a state of limbo ahead of events such as IEM Cologne and the Shanghai Major. Marc Winther, Director of Game Ecosystems - Counter-Strike at the ESL FACEIT Group, told HLTV that there had been discussions with multiple parties, including other tournament organizers and Valve, about this topic. ""However, we have nothing to share from these conversations."" He added: ""SOCD features are indeed allowed in our tournaments, and while we are monitoring the situation, there are no changes to that for now."" Janssen said that Wooting is considering implementing a tournament mode for the company's keyboards, allowing event organizers to disable certain features, including SOCD. ""This is something we would love, but TOs and Valve will have to decide what to do with all these different types of keyboard brands,"" he said. While this mode could be a workaround measure at LAN events, it wouldn't stop players from using these hardware features in online competitions or on matchmaking platforms, which are much, much harder to police. If you've been following the Counter-Strike scene long enough, you will have noticed the volatility of the space, where what you know today might not be applicable tomorrow. It's been nearly a month since Snap Tap was released, and we're still nowhere closer to understanding the full potential of these features or even knowing for a fact that they will be here for good. For now, all we can do is sit back and enjoy the games. The show, as they say, must go on.",6-8-2024 10:04,1722931440000

Six key talking points ahead of IEM Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39533/six-key-talking-points-ahead-of-iem-cologne,"With 24 teams looking to brawl their way to the IEM Cologne trophy, what are the crucial narratives fans should look out for? IEM Cologne 2024 is just around the corner and is set to kick off with the play-in on Wednesday, August 7. Sixteen teams are ready to start their campaign in the tournament's stacked first stage, which features nine top-20 sides and promises an exciting fight for a spot at the main event, where the world's top eight rosters await them. With so many matches between teams in different stages of their lifespans, the event will no doubt serve up some unexpected results and twists. This article delves into some of the biggest storylines ahead of the circuit's entrance into the Cathedral of Counter-Strike. IEM Cologne promises yet another interesting clash among the top dogs. Six teams come in with realistic expectations about lifting the trophy, with the sextet sharing every Big Event win since HEROIC won the BLAST Premier Spring Final in June 2023. Natus Vincere enter the event as the world's No. 1 team and will be looking to win their second tournament of the season after their Esports World Cup triumph, but their BLAST Fall Groups campaign wasn't stellar after two losses to the new Liquid. Spirit fared better in Copenhagen and won three straight games to qualify despite barely scraping by Complexity, which prompted Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia to admit that the team isn't at its best. Despite the small sample size, Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets seemed to have returned to his best at BLAST Groups and put up a rating 0.41 higher than in Riyadh, with the youngster needed in top form if Spirit are to win. MOUZ had a calmer entry into the season due to not being a BLAST partner and only have their EWC campaign to look back on. They were solid if unspectacular there, but will no doubt be motivated to get rid of their 'studio-LAN experts' moniker with a good performance in Cologne. Next up on the list are Vitality, who are the only favorites without a title in 2024. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut and company have been a constant playoff fixture that couldn't make the final step so far, and their two consecutive event wins at the end of 2023 seem a distant memory. With ZywOo still no doubt gunning for the number-one spot at the end of the year, a standout performance from their superstar might just give the European combine a title at last. The new-look G2 are also in with a chance after having made an unexpected pair of roster changes in the off-season. Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski has a solid grasp of the calling and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa is proving to be a sharpshooter, meaning the team has only lost one series after the break — an EWC grand final loss to Natus Vincere. If the honeymoon period still lasts in time for Cologne, Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and company are in with a chance of a second consecutive Cologne trophy. Last but not least on the list of favorites are FaZe. While it might be easy to overlook them due to their recent form, Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's troops have shown time and time again that they come alive at the most important moments. If FaZe can click early at the event, their experience can propel them to an unexpected title victory. Outside of the main favorites, Virtus.pro, Astralis, and Liquid have all proven they can at least upset the big dogs and play the role of spoiler, even if they might not have the biggest chance of the trophy. Outside of the usual favorites, several teams will be looking to claim their spot among the world's elite. The MongolZ have recently entered the top 10 in the world rankings for the first time in their history after a fantastic run of form that included wins at MESA Nomadic Masters and YaLLa Compass. They missed out on the playoffs at EWC, but their form makes them one of the favorites to make it through the play-in. 9z are another team in good shape. Their breakout semi-final finish at IEM Dallas, where they beat MOUZ and Vitality, and a victory at the FireLEAGUE Global Finals, give them a solid chance to upset. The South Americans haven't had many chances to showcase their skill since then and should make it to the group stage at least, with their efforts hinging on the form of European import Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez. On the other side of the spectrum, several teams will be looking to break out of a rut in Cologne. Despite the season starting less than a month ago we have already seen some damning interviews by karrigan and Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski on their team's form, but they aren't the only ones feeling the pressure. Complexity showed a better face at BLAST Groups and almost took down Spirit, but their Jekyll and Hyde nature showed up once again as they lost to a HEROIC side with Eetu ""sAw"" Saha on the server and narrowly beat OG with a stand-in. EliGE gave an honest overview of the situation after their EWC exit, too. ""It's tiring because we haven't been getting better with these types of mistakes, they're too frequent and this is how you lose games,"" he said after the loss to M80. ""Our comms are fine at the beginning of the round and then everything breaks down really quickly. We lose rounds that we shouldn't and give away a lot of advantages."" FaZe are in a similar boat, with team captain karrigan speaking to HLTV ahead of BLAST Spring Groups and admitting the team lacks the killer instinct and confidence they became known for. Falcons and Virtus.pro are also not in the best shape, as the two teams have never gotten going after their latest roster changes. Falcons have improved slightly with Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen on the roster but are still falling way short of their lofty ambitions, while Virtus.pro are yet to solve the style clash since Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov's signing. Two new rosters that didn't appear at the Esports World Cup are Liquid and BIG, whose only games after the summer break came at the lower-stakes BLAST Fall Groups. Liquid passed their first test with aplomb as they took down the No. 1 team in the world Natus Vincere twice and qualified for the Fall Final. Doubts over Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's in-game-leading credentials have been at least somewhat quashed, and his fragging power remained a force to be reckoned with as he averaged a 1.20 rating. Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak showed a high ceiling on the AWP despite this only being his second career LAN tournament, and starred in the qualification series decider against Natus Vincere with a 1.66 rating, while Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis seemed to have began a resurgence with a couple of standout maps. BIG had a rougher time in Copenhagen but did show glimpses of their potential with a win against Virtus.pro, during which Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische had one of his most impactful performances in a while. Their addition of Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi is still a work in progress, but the Swiss rifler had his best performance in a BIG jersey against Natus Vincere, where he was far and away the best player on the team. Four Brazilian teams will be present at IEM Cologne, with all four starting their road in the play-in. FURIA will lead the charge for their country after their encouraging debut with Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros at the Esports World Cup, where they progressed through the resurrection stage and gave MOUZ a run for their money in the quarters. Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato and Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos were both impressive in Riyadh, with skullz providing some standout moments as the team's third star. While it's unclear if this lineup will finally give Brazil a tier-one presence again, the early signs have been encouraging. In worse news for Brazilian fans, three of their teams have been put in the same bracket. FURIA will meet Imperial in the opening round, with paiN facing off against Liquid in the other match. With Liquid off to a great start, it's difficult to envision the Brazilians avoiding the lower bracket early on. paiN and Imperial are also making their tier-one debuts with their new signings. Santino ""try"" Rigal will make his LAN debut with Imperial after starring in several online qualifiers, where he averaged a 1.21 rating, while João ""snow"" Vinicius has averaged a 1.06 rating for paiN after adjusting to new, more passive roles. Brazil's fourth representatives are MIBR, who have been in a rotten run of form of late and won nine rounds across three maps at EWC. They will meet HEROIC in the first round and also have 9z and 3DMAX on their side of the bracket. In an interesting turn of events, the world's top eight teams have secured direct invites to the Cologne group stage, with the 9-16th ranked teams all starting their campaign in the play-in. Having the world's top 16 teams present would require a lack of upsets in the notoriously surprise-heavy play-in, however, even though upsets should be less common in theory after ESL removed the opening best-of-one matches. Another problem will be the fact that Falcons face off against Eternal Fire in the first round of the tournament, meaning one top-16 team will find itself in the lower bracket early on. 3DMAX, MIBR, and BIG, are the three closest teams in terms of ranking and should therefore have the highest chance of upsetting the apple cart, but are far from the only ones capable of causing an upset. Other than that, the seeding has been relatively kind this time around, so an event featuring just the top 16 teams might just be on the cards for the first time in history. The closest we came in recent times was IEM Katowice 2021, where we had 14 out of the top 16 present after Complexity (No. 8) and fnatic (No. 12) were eliminated in the play-in.",6-8-2024 17:04,1722956640000
"AZR: ""Australia has talented riflers that don't get experience overseas, TALON can give them that""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39536/azr-australia-has-talented-riflers-that-dont-get-experience-overseas-talon-can-give-them-that,"The Australian captain is looking forward to developing Oceanic Counter-Strike once again. Aaron ""AZR"" Ward is a player synonymous with Australian Counter-Strike, having represented his country at eight Majors under Vox Eminor and Renegades. Since 2019, however, he hasn't appeared at a tier-one event, and the 31-year-old admits that he began wondering if he wants to continue playing CS after a short-lived period in Sprout at the start of 2023. He wasn't done with the game yet, however, as Justin ""jks"" Savage's benching meant the duo was back on the FACEIT grind, which AZR mentioned as a big help in regaining motivation. TALON then presented him a chance to build a new Oceanic roster with a bit of European flair, and the Australian IGL has taken on the task of preparing the team for the Shanghai Major qualification cycle. Before TALON take part in the Australian open qualifiers, AZR spoke to HLTV to discuss his ill-fated Sprout stint, his time away from the game, and how the TALON roster came to be. You are a part of the new TALON roster as the IGL. How does it feel to be back on the grind? It feels pretty good. I have been away from the game quite a lot during these last couple of years. I had a brief stint with Sprout, which didn't last too long, and then after that, I was wondering if I still wanted to play CS. Then jks got benched at the start of the year, so I just started playing more Counter-Strike with him. So yeah, I started playing a lot more Counter-Strike, wanted to get back into it, and here we are. You lasted 45 days on your last team, Sprout. What went wrong there, and did that stint impact your chances of returning to the server? It definitely impacted my self-confidence. Also, I'm assuming orgs put my name further down the list or something like that after it (laughs). But Sprout had quite a lot of internal issues at the time, I would say. There were a lot of issues with the players, roles, and stuff like that. But I think for myself, the main thing was that I just wasn't ready to play yet. As I said before, in between the last team and Sprout, I wasn't playing much CS at all, to be honest. Coming into the team and having to learn different maps and strats, it was a lot to take in a month before an RMR. At the end of the day, I just wasn't ready at that time. Your last match was over a year ago in CS:GO. How does it feel to return to a new game after more than a year? I'm feeling pretty good. Obviously, CSGO and CS2 are similar games, but it definitely brings a breath of fresh air after playing the same game for ten years. Being able to play a lot and now playing with the team feels really good. Only positive thoughts on everything so far. How much input did you have in putting this TALON roster together? I had a lot of input on picking the roster. Originally, we weren't sure if we wanted to go with an Oceanic core or if we wanted to be in Europe. But it just turned into the fact that we should stick to Australian roots, go with the Oceanic core, and try to build up the scene. Australia has some talented riflers, but they don't get the chance to go overseas and get more experience. So now we and TALON can give that to these younger players. Being able to practice in Europe is also a big thing. One of these talented riflers is nettik, who has been putting up crazy numbers in the regional scene. What is he like? I've enjoyed my time with Corey so far. He definitely has a lot of skill, and he has a bright future ahead of him. Obviously, there are things that he can fix, just like anyone else in the game, and he has a lot of potential for sure. If he improves on small things about his game, I think the sky's the limit for him. mhL will be taking the AWP role. Is his addition down to Oceania not having a standout sniper? From the get-go, I always wanted us to have a European AWPer. In Australia, and I'm not trying to talk down any AWPers in the region, but I feel like we just haven't had some crazy, consistent AWPers coming out of Australia. We've always had pretty good riflers, but I think we lack AWPers in Australia. So that was why I wanted to get a European player in the team. He was benched, and Daniel djL had a conversation with him, and then it just went from there. Another EU component is djL. He comes in with a huge amount of experience, so how has it been working with him and meshing your philosophies? The main thing for me when looking for the coach was making sure that we see things the same way and want to create a good culture for the team, and we see eye-to-eye with that. We had good conversations before actually signing. I enjoy having Daniel as the coach right now, and everything's been going pretty smoothly so far. I'm looking forward to building a good relationship with him. What are the expectations for the team? The Major was already mentioned as a huge milestone, so is that the be-all and end-all? Our short-term goal would definitely be making the Major. Every team wants to be at the Major, and it's no different for us. Right now, we're bootcamping in Europe to make sure we can go into the Oceanic qualifier in the best form we can. It's not much time, to be honest. We started practice maybe two and a half weeks ago, so it's a bit strenuous, but from the results we had in the first couple of days of practice to now, I think we're going up at a steady rate, and it's looking good. You said you are currently in Europe. Is the plan to stay here for most of the year? I think so. For us to get better as a team, we want to have as much time as possible in Europe. And I'm thankful to TALON, as they're accepting of that. They have a facility here, so the guys can come here and play in Europe. Australian practice isn't the greatest, so this is the biggest thing that can make us better. Having the European practice, whether we're versing tier-1, tier-2, or tier-3 teams, it's always good practice. You're always going to learn something, and these teams are going to punish you. So we're just learning a lot together as a team. You mentioned practice in Australia not being the best. How do you feel about the scene in general? The scene probably dipped a lot after COVID in general, with orgs backing out after losing money in Oceanic CS. So now, with FlyQuest and TALON investing in Australian and Oceanic Counter-Strike, it's just amazing. It's similar to back in the day, maybe like 2018, 2019, when we had us, Renegades, 100 Thieves, or whatever you want to call us, and then we also had another salaried team competing. On top of that, we had all these other little orgs that could still pay salaries to teams. Hopefully, we're going back to the way it was, and eventually, that will improve the scene even more. I'm thankful to TALON for investing in the Australian scene, for sure. Asian CS has been on the rise lately. The region got an extra Major spot as a result, but how would you describe your chances of making it to Shanghai? I'd say the teams are getting better in Asia and Oceania. Especially now, with The MongolZ really showing that they can be a force to be reckoned with, you can't underestimate them at any tournament now. They even won a tournament not long ago, so that's great for Asian CS in general. In terms of qualifying for the Major, we have to be realistic. We've only been a team now for three weeks or so, but the goal is to try and qualify. First off, we have to start with the RMR qualifier in Australia.  If we qualify for the RMR, then we'll have another two months or so to actually prepare, have more practice, and be able to build on what we're building now. So the goal is to be there, for sure. Talking about open qualifiers. Asia is the only region to keep them for his Major cycle. Do you have any thoughts on that? It sucks for the Europeans, right? There were a lot of organizations that have backed out because they don't have the chance to have that open qualifier, which sucks. It's good for Oceania and Asia that we still have these qualifiers, but over there, I can't say it's too great. I would have preferred if Valve just kept the open qualifiers because I think it was awesome. Last Major, you had ECSTATIC, who started in the open qualifiers and made it all the way to the Major. That's a sick story. You can just get five random people, get in there, and maybe some magic happens.",6-8-2024 20:01,1722967260000
Sangal secure consecutive titles with CCT S2 EU Series 7 victory,https://www.hltv.org/news/39539/sangal-secure-consecutive-titles-with-cct-s2-eu-series-7-victory,"xfl0ud powered his team to victory in terrifying form, ending the event with a 1.47 rating over nine maps. Sangal have won CCT Season 2 Europe Series 7 after powering past PARIVISION 2-0 in the grand final, fending off a comeback on Mirage (13-11) before trouncing the Russian team on Anubis (13-5). It is the second tournament victory on the trot for Linus ""LNZ"" Holtäng's side, who beat fnatic only nine days ago in the grand final of CCT EU Series 6 to earn a $22,000 prize. The upswing in results comes at an auspicious time for the Turkish organization, offering a boon of points in Valve's Regional Standings just ahead of the August 7 cut-off for the Perfect World Shanghai Major Europe RMR and RMR closed qualifier invites. The standings were updated shortly after Sangal's win over PARIVISION, and although that victory isn't included in the points calculation, LNZ side was already locked in for the EU RMR closed qualifier in 19th place and likely would not attain enough points to qualify for the RMR directly, needing over 100 to make it past Aurora. Sangal kicked off their CCT Series 7 campaign as they did their last — directly from the playoffs stage, courtesy of an invite. Resplendent form from Yasin ""xfl0ud"" Koç powered the team past Passion UA, 1WIN, and Permitta to reach the title decider, a run of seven maps in which the Turkish rifler averaged a 1.54 rating and posted the second-best map rating of his career (2.43). He had a quiet start to the grand final as Simon ""yxngstxr"" Boije led the charge in a dominant 10-round streak on the CT side of Mirage, and continued to struggle after the side swap as PARIVISION nearly pulled off a comeback only to fall at the final hurdle. xfl0ud's dominion resumed on Anubis, however, with the rifler obliterating Robert ""Patsi"" Isyanov and company with a 1.88 rating, 19-10 K-D, and 131.7 ADR to win 12 rounds straight to close out the map, 13-5.",6-8-2024 22:07,1722974820000
Counter-Strike's legacy in Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39537/counter-strikes-legacy-in-cologne,"There is no other place in the world that has borne witness to as many essential moments of CS history as Cologne. IEM Cologne is a pillar of competitive Counter-Strike. It is one of the marquee events in the calendar, one of the most prestigious events outside of the Majors, alongside IEM Katowice. Since HLTV's rankings were introduced by ESL One Cologne 2016, at least eight of the top 10 teams have attended every single one.  Everyone wants to win it, the winners go down in history and are remembered forever, and it is an indelible part of the legacies of the players who count the trophy among their spoils. Whilst the strength of the field is part of what makes IEM Cologne so special, a far more important factor is the history. The first ESL CS event took place 20 years ago in 2004, and since then a plethora of tournaments have taken place in Cologne, both in 1.6 and in CS:GO, and now in CS2. With the 10-year anniversary of Cologne's unbroken streak of yearly CS events on the horizon, there is no better time to take a look back at the history of Cologne's contribution to our game. Remember the best moments, the legacies that were forged, and the intangibly vital pieces of CS history that took place in the city. The city of Cologne is deeply embedded in Counter-Strike's history, from the early days of the professional scene. ESL was actually founded in Cologne in 2000, and so it is no surprise they forged such a strong link between CS and the city from the early moments of the game. CS 1.6's release came in 2003, and it was only a year later that ESL hosted their first event in Cologne, European Nations Champions 2004, which was won by a Team Sweden featuring legends like Abdisamad ""SpawN"" Mohamed and Emil ""HeatoN"" Christensen who were in the early stages of forging their legacies. These were the days when the very foundations of Counter-Strike esports were being laid, when first place meant tens of thousands of dollars at best, when even the top LAN events were a far cry from the arena spectacles that take pride of place among the circuit today. Cologne continued to host a smattering of CS tournaments over the 1.6 years, including IEM Season IV Global Challenge Gamescom in 2009. Swedish legend Patrik ""f0rest"" Lindberg was present playing for fnatic, Christopher ""GeT_RiGhT"" Alesund played alongside him having only joined the team earlier that year, but it was Fatih ""gob b"" Dayik and Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen who fought on opposite sides of the server in the final, in which the German triumphed. Some of the most notable, successful, and historic figures in our game put down the early milestones of their career in Cologne, and the city was an integral part of building the rich tapestry that makes CS so compelling. There was a gap in the history of Cologne's relationship with CS starting in 2010, but the city returned to the forefront of the professional scene early in CS:GO with a series of RaidCall EMS One tournaments over 2013, played in ESL's offices in the city. Ninjas in Pyjamas and VeryGames' rivarly, a defining feature of the early GO days, was prominent across these tournaments. Ninjas in Pyjamas got the better of VeryGames in Spring in the semi-finals, but the Frenchmen, bolstered by Belgian Adil ""ScreaM"" Benrlitom, came roaring back to claim revenge in the grand final in Fall. Cologne truly announced itself as a place right at the heart of CS history in 2014 with ESL One Cologne. It was a historic tournament not just because it was a Major, but also because it was the first and only Major won by the dominant force of the initial stages of CS:GO, Ninjas in Pyjamas. Having ensured their place in the annals of CS history by building the immense 87-0 LAN streak and winning countless trophies, one thing eluded the legends of Ninjas in Pyjamas: a Major title. They had been thwarted by a miraculous underdog performance by fnatic in their first attempt and mowed down by the unstoppable Virtus.plow in Poland at the second time of asking. Fittingly, Ninjas in Pyjamas took down their Swedish rivals of fnatic in a nail-biting grand final that went down to the wire on the final map of Inferno, with players like GeT_RiGhT and f0rest getting the Major their early dominance deserved. Of all the Ninjas in Pyjamas squad it was Adam ""friberg"" Friberg who got the MVP nod however, thanks to his immense impact and two career-defining plays in the grand final: his clutch on Cobblestone and his 3HP ace on Inferno, the latter of which earned him Valve's in-game recognition. Cologne hosted two more Majors in the following years, and both featured perhaps equally historic victories. fnatic rubber-stamped the second era of CS:GO by claiming their third Major trophy and second in a single year at ESL One Cologne 2015, ensuring the enduring legacies of the squad. In the grand final of said tournament, fnatic earned a team-wide in-game immortalisation with their quadruple AWP peek down Middle on Dust2. The Brazilian legends, with Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo and Marcelo ""coldzera"" David at the forefront, bagged the second of their back-to-back Major victories at ESL One Cologne 2016, in a tournament which featured a plethora of spine-tingling highlights. Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev's falling double-noscope was the best of the bunch, which earned the GOAT an in-game graffiti of his own. In fact, of all the in-game graffitis that ever found their way into Counter-Strike, many of them happened in Cologne, and almost all of them happened in the Major years. Cologne continued to carve itself into the annals of CS history even after it had hosted its three Majors, the only city to ever do so three years consecutively. In 2017 one of the more light-hearted memorable moments took place, the football match between Virtus.pro's legendary Polish lineup and the Brazilians of SK, who had just won the Cologne trophy. Dubbed ""Round 31,"" the unusual face-off emphasized the respect and camaraderie present even between heated rivals in the game, and was a credit to our professional scene. It may not be a rousing trophy win, but this moment sits fondly in the memories of those who were around to witness it. One of the greatest underdog runs in CS history graced Cologne's soil in 2018, and in poetic fashion it was made by home-town heroes BIG. Far before BIG became a world-class force in the online era, gob b and Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz rocked the CS world by taking down the likes of Liquid, MIBR and FaZe on their way to the grand final, leaving a litany of legends and Major-winners in their wake. Aided by a little slice of UKCS in the form of Owen ""smooya"" Butterfield, BIG could not quite overcome a s1mple-powered Natus Vincere in the final, but nonetheless they did their nation proud and ensured their memorable run would go down in history. Who remembers the Liquid of 2019? The real NA juggernaut, one that in a furious and frenetic run of a handful of tournaments rocketed themselves to the pinnacle of the scene and claimed the top spot among a field of incredibly strong challengers. This Liquid sealed the second season of the Intel Grand Slam in a staggering 63 days, and where did they seal it? At ESL One Cologne 2019. Liquid's run of five elite tournament wins back-to-back over the summer of 2019 might be the most immense run of all time, and Cologne was an integral piece. The online era might have put a bit of a dampener on the professional scene, but Cologne's name still managed to attach itself to another piece of history. HEROIC, helmed by Casper ""cadiaN"" Møller and featuring Martin ""stavn"" Lund and René ""TeSeS"" Madsen, put themselves on the map and won the organization's first-ever elite tournament win in staggering fashion in ESL One Cologne 2020 Europe, dominating the World No. 2, Vitality, 3-0 in the grand final. cadiaN and HEROIC would go on to become one of the most consistent tier-one squads across the next few years, and it all started with ESL One Cologne. The online era ended in 2021 and there was no better place to return to LAN than at IEM Cologne. Gambit's youthful squad had emerged from the woodwork and positioned themselves as the No. 1 team in online play, but were brought crashing down to reality when the pressures of LAN CS took hold. Instead it was Natus Vincere who emerged triumphant. It was the first LAN victory of NAVI's mini-era, s1mple bagged the MVP, NAVI continued their journey towards the Intel Grand Slam, and another vital chapter of CS lore was written in Cologne. IEM Cologne 2022 is more memorable than anything for its grand final, the epic five-map affair between two of the greatest sides the game has ever seen, FaZe and Natus Vincere. Natus Vincere had been comfortably the best team in the world in 2021 and had the No. 2 spot after winning the previous LAN. FaZe had dominated the first half of 2022 and won PGL Major Antwerp, but form had dipped. What ensued was one of the greatest series in all of CS:GO's long history. Four of the five maps featured 29 rounds of Counter-Strike or more, both teams played at the peak of their powers in front of a packed crowd, and there was highlight after memorable highlight. FaZe triumphed to cement 2022 as their year, having won IEM Katowice and the Major prior to their Cologne triumph. Yet again Cologne was a moment in time where a team cemented their legacy. There are plenty of historic individual tournament showings that have taken place in CS down the years. One happened just recently, when Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets emphatically announced his credentials as a superstar by dominating IEM Katowice. One that isn't spoken about enough is Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač's demolition of IEM Cologne 2023, a performance that delivered the Katowice-Cologne double to a GOAT rifler who didn't quite have the trophy cabinet that his immense skill deserved. At IEM Cologne 2023 NiKo put in star performances against FaZe, Vitality and ENCE, who at that exact moment were perhaps the three best teams in the world. He put up immense numbers in terms of kills and damage all whilst playing a marauding style of Counter-Strike, leading the tournament in total opening kills and impact rating. It was a historic individual performance as well as a historic tournament victory in context, a beautiful way for CS:GO's best rifler to capture the second of a pair of trophies that finally decorated his trophy cabinet in a way befitting his stature. IEM Cologne 2024 is a particularly momentous occasion as it will mark 10 years of unbroken CS history in Cologne, and 10 Cologne LAN tournaments back-to-back. Only Katowice can claim to be as intrinsically embedded within the annals of CS, and even then Katowice cannot lay claim to the sheer number of incredible highlights and momentous happenings that have taken place in Cologne over the years. Three different iterations of the game can credit Cologne as a place where history has been made. Many of the graffiti-worthy, legend-making moments that were immortalized in the very game we all love took place in Cologne. Every single great team and player had to firmly stamp their greatness upon Cologne, and to not do so was a mark against them. More history will be made at IEM Cologne 2024. We all have the utmost privilege to see who writes it.",6-8-2024 22:41,1722976860000
Final Valve Ranking update issued ahead of Shanghai Major RMR & qualifier invites,https://www.hltv.org/news/39540/final-valve-ranking-update-issued-ahead-of-shanghai-major-rmr-qualifier-invites,"The tentative list of teams invited to the Shanghai Major RMRs and its qualifiers is now known. Valve has released the final update to its Regional Standings ahead of the previously announced cut-off date of August 7, and as such the teams invited to the Perfect World Shanghai Major RMRs and its qualifiers can be determined. The ranking doesn't factor in some results from August 6 and came a day earlier than expected, leaving uncertainty around whether the list was final or another update would follow. However, HLTV has confirmed with Valve that today's updated ranking will be the one used to determine invites for the Shanghai Major qualifying circuit. Valve also confirmed to HLTV that organizations that have multiple teams qualified in different regions or for different stages (for example, Imperial at the Americas RMR and Imperial fe at the Europe RMR closed qualifier) cannot compete with both teams. Asia remains the only region to still offer an open qualifying circuit, with five teams from sub-regional qualifiers set to join The MongolZ, FlyQuest, and Lynn Vision at the Asia RMR. Teams from Europe and the Americas have no open qualifier avenue and will be invited directly to the RMR or closed qualifiers, with the latter region split into North and South America until the RMR proper. Pending official confirmation, HLTV has put together a presumptive list of invites after removing any secondary or tertiary lineups by organizations, sorting teams into the RMR they are expected to compete in, and accounting for any duplicate rosters listed in Valve's ranking. Europe RMR Europe RMR closed qualifiers *Valve's ranking lists the roster Cloud9 used for the Esports World Cup Europe qualifier, which includes Daniil ""alpha"" Demin, Ilya ""Perfecto"" Zalutskiy, and Abay ""HObbit"" Khassenov. It is unknown whether the team will receive an invite by listing Perfecto to retain their core and then substitute in a player from their current lineup. If they do not receive an invite, Metizport are next in line for a spot. The following teams were removed by HLTV from the Europe standings: - Liquid, Wildcard because they are expected to compete in Americas- MOUZ NXT, Imperial fe, Aurora Young Blud because they have their main teams invited elsewhere- BLEED, Monte because they were listed twice and already have their newer lineups invited Americas RMR South America closed qualifier** North America closed qualifier** **South American teams living in and competing in North America can choose to play in either qualifier. As such, the exact list of teams for each region will not be known until the official confirmation.***ex-Limitless disbanded; it is unknown whether the team will accept the invitation. Asia RMR Asia closed qualifiers (China, East Asia, Oceania, Middle East, Rest of Asia)**** ****Invites for the sub-regional Asia closed qualifiers are incomplete as only Oceania has enough ranked teams to fill all invite spots in its qualifier.",6-8-2024 23:47,1722980820000
SAW stun The MongolZ in IEM Cologne opener,https://www.hltv.org/news/39542/saw-stun-the-mongolz-in-iem-cologne-opener,"BIG took down FlyQuest in a scrappy affair on the other stream. The MongolZ are one loss away from early elimination at IEM Cologne after crumbling on defence against SAW for a 1-2 defeat. Home team BIG, meanwhile, beat FlyQuest and did well to bounce back after dropping map one in heartbreaking fashion by seeing a 9-3 lead disappear. The two victors will clash tomorrow at 13:30  for a slot in Stage 2 of IEM Cologne. SAW have not played on LAN since BLAST Spring Final before the break, and came into their opener full of energy, preparation, and well-oiled executions as the impact of new head coach Danny ""BERRY"" Krüger was felt. ""The end of the season was a bit tough for us, we weren't used to being on big stages and we were a bit tired,"" Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes said pre-game. ""But it's not an excuse. The big teams play every event, they don't have time to practice. Right now, we have a lot of energy."" Despite their good practice and preparation, it was a slow start for the Portuguese as they went down 8-4 on the CT side of Anubis. They were lucky to even reach four rounds, needing this sensational double noscope from João ""story"" Vieira to do so. As the sides flipped, however, SAW eased into top gear and brutally punished a poor game from Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar by repeatedly hitting the weak B bomb site. Later in the half, conditioning forced The MongolZ into 3-0-2 and 2-0-3 setups that gave up Middle entirely which gave Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto the chance to walk out for free. Then, at 10-10, a perfect set piece on B with three Molotovs put SAW in the lead. The MongolZ did recover to overtime thanks to some strong play from Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold, but SAW's momentum proved too strong for a 16-13 win. After The MongolZ swept to an easy victory on their pick of Ancient, normal service was restored with SAW racing to a 7-1 lead on Dust2's decider with another well-executed game plan on offence. All three of SAW's young trio story, ewjerkz, and Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing had key moments and multi-kills to keep the streak going and the half eventually ended 10-2. The upset was then confirmed, 13-5. BIG and FlyQuest also endured a back-and-forth battle on map one, entering overtime just like The MongolZ and SAW after a big T side comeback. Joshua ""INS"" Potter and Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi were the two key forces as 9-3 T halves were traded, with INS and FlyQuest eventually securing the 1-0 lead. Map two, FlyQuest's pick of Inferno, was close from the get-go with a 6-6 first half but BIG rallied — with rigoN impressing again — to take it. Vertigo followed, and was a stomp in the first half. Karim ""Krimbo"" Moussa joined rigoN in putting the Australians to the sword as BIG sprinted off to a 10-0 lead. It wasn't such a clean cut, however. It got scrappy at the stretch, whiffs and all, but BIG avoided a massive choke in the final two rounds to close it out in regulation, 13-11, crushing FlyQuest's massive comeback attempt.",7-8-2024 14:00,1723032000000
Can 9z surprise again as they adjust to life in Europe?,https://www.hltv.org/news/39538/can-9z-surprise-again-as-they-adjust-to-life-in-europe,"The South American squad ended the Spring season on a high and are now embarking on a new journey in Europe, starting at the IEM Cologne Play-in. Counter-Strike fans can largely be separated into two categories: those who support their local team along national or regional lines because they feel most represented by a nation or culture — a dying breed as teams are becoming increasingly international with no defined geographical anchors — and those who follow the game's brightest stars and best-performing teams. In sports, where one is often bound by geography, tradition, or both, glory chasers are generally scoffed at. Esports, on the other hand, largely operate on a global scale and can be rather decentralized due to their virtual nature. 9z's fans tend to belong to the first group, coming together from Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and even Spain. But there's also a smaller subset of romantic fans who do not belong to either of the aforementioned groups, a dying breed in the age of influencers, who find it appealing to invest emotionally in the minnows, the underdogs, the downtrodden, and those who fight against the odds — even despite the palpable risk of it bringing more heartbreak than glory. Those fans, wherever they may be from, now have another team to cheer on while they keep up with the likes of The MongolZ, Eternal Fire, and paiN, as La Violeta is tasked with proving that the recent IEM Dallas semi-final run and FiReLEAGUE grand final victory over fnatic were not just a flash in the pan. Some may have even been following 9z for years since it's not the first time the club's name is in the headlines. They became the first Spanish-speaking team from Latin America to qualify for a Major in 2022 when they scraped through the PGL Major Antwerp Americas RMR with a 2-0 victory against paiN in the sixth-place decider match, and repeated the feat at the IEM Road to Rio RMR with a cleaner 3-1 record. Since then, they have been making the occasional appearance at a Big Event, albeit generally without much success. The team underwent some deep changes in early 2022 before breaking out on the world stage at the Antwerp Major's RMR. Veteran in-game leader Bruno ""BIT"" Fukuda Lima hung up his mouse and took a coaching job at MIBR, while the young and up-and-coming AWPer Santino ""try"" Rigal, a product of the team's academy who made waves with the main team in 2020 and 2021, left to join Marcelo ""coldzera"" David and Epitacio ""TACO"" de Melo in a 00NATION roster which also included G2's Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa. Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez stepped up under the leadership of Rafael ""zakk"" Fernandes and took the reins as the team's new caller while the new signings, David ""dav1deuS"" Tapia Maldonado and Luca ""Luken"" Nadotti, — and later Lucas ""nqz"" Soares —, provided more than enough firepower to propel the team forward. It's also important to note that star rifler Franco ""dgt"" Garcia stayed put. ""I've been in 9z a long time, and I know how it works,"" he tells HLTV. ""My life is built around that. I'm not saying I'll be here forever, but I want to make it with this team and with these players. ""I've had calls from different teams over the years, but Counter-Strike isn't very big in our region, in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, so I want to make it far with this team so that more people from our region will be attracted to the game, follow us, and then follow in our footsteps. That's more important than going to a Brazilian or international team to win. It's more important for me, and for our region, that this team wins something for the first time. Brazilians have already won a lot, it wouldn't be something historical if they win more, so it's more important for me that we win."" 9z cooled off in 2023 when the team's Brazilian duo, coach zakk and AWPer nqz, went back home as try returned from his sojourn to play under the orders of the new skipper, Gustavo ""tge"" Motta. They failed to qualify for the BLAST.tv Paris Major, but made it to several Big Events: IEM Rio, IEM Dallas, and ESL Pro League Season 18. They didn't do much at the IEMs, but reached the Pro League playoffs and even defeated Virtus.pro in the first round before falling in the second round to Movistar Riders, who were fielding AWPer Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez in his first full year on a professional contract. The end-of-year turbulence reappeared in 2024. dav1deuS stepped down in October as the team was planning a future move to Europe, something the Chilean rifler didn't want to get on board with, and a week later try followed suit. ""All of the players who have come through 9z brought their own things and had their own ways of doing things,"" max says, ""but me and dgt, my Uruguayan countryman and longest-standing teammate, always try to keep the essence of 9z as more than a team. ""We try to make sure that we're not just teammates but also friends and people who get along outside of the server because we want to bring that positive dynamic into the server so that everything flows in the best way possible. Our team culture is very important and I think that, as Latin Americans, it's in our blood to be more than just teammates. We try to make it a part of our daily lives."" 9z dug into their academy system to find a rifler who could fill the talented dav1deuS' shoes, as they had done in 2022 when they needed an anchor and Nicolás ""buda"" Kramer was brought on board. This time around, one Chilean rifler made way for another, and Matias ""HUASOPEEK"" Ibañez Hernandez stepped into dav1deuS' shoes. ""HUASO's adaptation was quicker than expected,"" max says. ""We knew he had a lot of potential, but I didn't expect he would understand many of the things he does or that he would learn them so quickly. Even to this day he listens and learns a lot and improves daily."" The organization then broke the bank to sign MartinezSa, who had been Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García's substitute in Movistar Riders, to man the big green, traditionally a position that shines in max's setup. The Spanish AWPer, who was starting to find his footing in the big leagues, had become skeptical of Riders' chances following the departure of longtime in-game leader Alejandro ""alex"" Masanet to Ninjas in Pyjamas and decided to place a bet on the Latin American squad since they were planning a move to Europe. The fact that their path to the Major is through the Americas instead of the hyper-competitive European RMR was the cherry on top. ""We went to Brazil because we had the RMR's closed qualifier,"" MartinezSa says. ""The plan was to come to Spain sooner, but in the end, we had to postpone it and play some tournaments and qualifiers from Argentina."" The team's first months together were mixed. They had successful runs in the IEM Chengdu and IEM Dallas qualifiers, but failures to make it to the Major and ESL Pro League cast doubt on how good this team could become. 9z were paired with G2 in their opening series in China, which they lost in a close best-of-one, and were subsequently eliminated by HEROIC. A month later an exciting best-of-one opening victory against FURIA at GET Rio quickly lost its sheen when it was followed by losses to Imperial and OG. MartinezSa laughs when asked about those early days, living in Buenos Aires, and if there were any moments of regret when the team wasn't fully working. ""If it's done, it's done,"" he says. ""I don't regret the decisions I make, so even when things weren't working out that great, I'd say that I wasn't really regretting the decision to move. ""Looking back on it now, I'd say it was a positive experience,"" he adds. ""If you ask me to relive what I did in the past six or seven months, I'd tell you that I'd do it all over again, so the balance is positive."" What made it a net positive in the end was, no doubt, the way 9z turned up in May. After finishing second in CBCS Season 4 with Luken playing as a stand-in in the last two matches, MartinezSa and his teammates went on a tear at IEM Dallas. They beat MOUZ, the number one team in the world at the time, in the best-of-one opener, then took out a struggling Liquid to secure a playoff spot, and defeated Vitality in the group stage final for a berth straight into the semi-finals. A vintage performance by Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač on Inferno gave the edge to G2 on stage at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, which they won by a slim 13-11 margin before taking the series 2-0 on Dust2. G2 went on to become champions the following day, much to the delight of the American crowd, who were cheering on stand-in Jake ""Stewie2K"" Yip and even dubbed the team GStew. ""The beginning of any season is hard for most teams,"" dgt says. ""You have to try things and adapt to see what works. I think one of the things that really worked for us at the end of the season compared to the beginning was that we had no pressure, and we just had a good time. It's very important to feel unleashed."" That feeling continued at the FiReLEAGUE Global Finals, where the quality of teams in attendance wasn't as good as IEM Dallas, but still a competitive field for a team like 9z. It was no small feat for them to prevail over three top 30 teams, paiN, KOI, and fnatic, to raise the trophy in front of their home fans. MartinezSa, showing his best in a system designed for him to flourish, was named the first ever Dust2.com.br MVP of the tournament after topping the charts with a 1.43 rating in 9 maps. Finally, the Spring season came to a close and the big moment arrived. 9z moved to Europe after the summer vacation to continue chasing their dream. ""Madrid is lovely,"" max says when asked about the team's first few weeks in the Spanish capital. ""It took us longer than planned to move here because we wanted to make sure we came to Spain for everyone to have a life outside of Counter-Strike in a country where we all speak the language,"" he adds. ""We're very happy. Spain is a beautiful country, and we feel very welcome everywhere we go. It's great to have the opportunity to be here."" MartinezSa is naturally also happy to be back in his home country, where he now lives with the team, while dgt has more reservations. While it's all a bit too new and fresh for the Uruguayan to really know how he feels about it, it's more of a pragmatic means to an end than anything else. ""I'd take staying at home over moving here any day, if I'm honest,"" he says, ""but we need to make some sacrifices if we want to realize our dreams, and this is one of them."" 9z's move to Europe is a long-term affair, they're not here just to test the waters, and many of the battles they will now face are psychological. The distance from home and loved ones is perhaps the most obvious, but another spooky prospect is fighting in the online jungle of lower-tier European Counter-Strike, which could send even the most battle-hardened veteran to the asylum. Of course, it's something max and the rest of his teammates have thought about and prepared for. ""I wouldn't say we're nervous about it,"" max says, ""but teams here really do demand more of you, and we need to understand that. We've talked about this, and we're conscious of it. We're also not coming here with the expectation of landing and, in a month or two, becoming a top team. ""This is all part of a process that begins with adapting to life here in Madrid as well as adapting to playing against these teams daily. I have plenty of confidence in the team, but I'm aware that it's a process and won't just happen overnight. ""At the same time, we have to make sure that it doesn't undermine our confidence but rather that every practice day becomes a learning opportunity and that, when we get to a tournament, we've channeled everything we've learned and can show it at the events we play in."" dgt also spoke soberly about the team's need to pace itself. ""Everything takes time,"" he says. ""Just because we played two good tournaments doesn't mean we'll always play well, especially right after we had a break. But now we know that we have the ability to reach that level, and it's just about putting in the time and effort."" Despite any uncertainty or nervousness that may creep up at such a volatile time, the team knows where its strengths lie and how joy and brotherhood are the keys to success. ""It's more mental than about the game itself,"" MartinezSa says. ""We've spoken about this several times and the conclusion we came to is that we have to enjoy ourselves and enjoy what we're doing. If you're enjoying yourself, you'll automatically play your best, you'll get along well with your teammates, and everything will just flow."" Amid all the excitement that comes with moving halfway across the world in pursuit of a dream, 9z's players now have their eyes fixed on one of the biggest challenges in their careers at the IEM Cologne Play-in. On the banks of the Rhine they will try to put their feel-good philosophy into play and give their fans, those back home and those who love a good underdog story, something to cheer for. ""We know that it's probably the most emblematic tournament on the calendar, and we want to have a good showing, but we don't want to give it so much importance that it could hurt us,"" MartinezSa says. ""We're focusing on it the same way we did for the last tournaments before the summer break, which is to make sure we go out there and enjoy ourselves,"" he adds, reminiscent of Riders' mindset when they became the first Spanish team to reach a Major in 2021. ""I'm sure we'll play well if we're enjoying ourselves there, that's the key."" While the official line may be to play it cool and keep a level head before such a momentous occasion, it's a bit harder for max to hide his enthusiasm. ""I'm very excited to play in Cologne, it's a legendary event,"" he says. ""I've been watching it since I was a little boy and I always wanted to play there. That alone is already a dream come true.""",7-8-2024 00:45,1722984300000
"MUTiRiS: ""Today was just one win; we're happy, but we need to keep our feet on the ground""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39543/mutiris-today-was-just-one-win-were-happy-but-we-need-to-keep-our-feet-on-the-ground,"The Portuguese captain spoke with HLTV after SAW moved past The MongolZ in Cologne. SAW got their IEM Cologne Play-In campaign off to a flying start as they moved past world No.11 The MongolZ in a three-map affair. The Portuguese team took the lead in the series with an overtime Anubis win and bounced back from an Ancient beating with a blowout victory on Dust2. The victory comes as a big source of relief for SAW, whose slow start in ESL Pro League 19 proved costly. Then, at the BLAST Premier Spring Final, they were defeated by FaZe and Astralis without picking up a single map. After the match against The MongolZ, Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes sat down with HLTV to dissect the opening match and discuss the team's fluctuating form and the goals for Cologne and beyond. You've just beaten The MongolZ, one of the big favorites to make it to the group stage. What are you feeling? It's a very good feeling. In this sort of tournament, it has been hard for us to impose our game and win right off the bat. When we analyzed MongolZ, we saw that they are a very aggressive team. I think that, tactically, they are a very simple team, but they're very good in that sense. We were able to figure out more or less what they could do, and we knew we'd have to be on point because they have good aim. I think we came into this tournament with a very good mentality, and I think BERRY has been helping us a lot with that. I am very happy because we've finally started a tournament really well. The MongolZ were the second-highest seed coming into the Play-In. What was the key to your victory? We've been practicing really well. We feel that every day we learn something new. Basically, we feel that, in these events, sometimes things aren't working out because something isn't clicking. This is a big victory, The MongolZ are perhaps the tier-two team that is the closest to tier-one.  Beating a team like this shows that we're working well, and I can't not be happy. You had some great T sides in this series, on Anubis and Dust2. Is that something you have been working on? Yes, of course. I mean, our T sides have always been good. We have been working a lot on our CT sides because we have struggled on them sometimes and things might not be working, but I think believing is key. Sometimes we'd get frustrated or things wouldn't work out and we'd stop believing halfway through games. Now, we have a clear head, which I think has been very good. What was the preparation for this event like? Did you bootcamp? Yes, we had a bootcamp, and it was slightly different than usual because we had some official matches. So, we wanted people to get out of their comfort zone and play matches away from home. We knew we were our biggest enemies, so we had to play with a lot of confidence, and that's what happened. What has it been like to work with BERRY? I watched your pre-match interview, and you said that you still had some things to work on regarding communication. BERRY's forte is in-game stuff, so of course it would be perfect for the coach to understand everything we say to fix some things. But we are very happy, because Counter-Strike is a universal language, and he has been helping us a lot in that sense. For us, it has been great. As I've said before, he has a completely different background. We had some bad habits from previous years, and he has been helping us with that. Not everything is perfect, but I am extremely happy because he is a simple coach who goes straight to the problems. Oftentimes, we overcomplicate some small things and he makes them very simple. It has been very good to work with someone like BERRY. You had a very strong start to the year that culminated in your qualification for the Major and the BLAST Finals, but your form has fluctuated in recent months. Why do you think this has been happening, and do you think this can be a turning point for your team? I think so, but it's very hard to get to the level of tier-one teams. We are battling to be a tier-two team and trying to get closer to tier-one, and we have to know that, sometimes, it is hard to improve or get to that level. But hard work has always characterized our team. BERRY has helped us with that because he is someone with more experience. So I think that is our goal, to try to be more consistent on LAN and to believe in ourselves more. Our scrims are really good, we're constantly scrimming against the best in the world, we know what we can do, and what we need to do is to come to these tournaments and continue the work we do at home. BERRY said in your podcast that he believed the team could make it to the group stage. Do you think the same way? What are your expectations? Yes, I think that as a team we've set a goal, which is to get through to the next stage. We're not afraid to say that, because if we work every day, this is what it's all about. I always say that it's good to get to a big tournament and gain experience, but there has to be a tournament where we get there and really show our level. Today was just one win. We're happy but we need to keep our feet on the ground. We have the level to beat the best, but sometimes it's not possible or we're not playing so well and it doesn't happen. We're happy because maybe most people thought we couldn't win and we proved we're here to battle with the best. Last night, it was revealed that you'll be invited to the closed qualifier for the RMR. What are your expectations for the rest of the year? Is making the Shanghai Major your goal? Yes, I believe that's always SAW's goal. We were close to qualifying for Majors so many times before Copenhagen that it started to get tough. We've done it once, and now we want to go for it a second time. So that is clearly the goal. But, as I've said, it depends on our work and our form when the time comes. I hope we will be at the Major. You are now going up against BIG, a team you haven't faced in a year. Do you think it's possible to beat them and reach the next stage with a 2-0 record? BIG are always a very tough team to face. But I think we have to sit down, come up with a good plan and see which maps we're going to play. Basically, it will have to be the same as for this match, where we played with a lot of confidence. We can't just win tactically, we have to be good individually. We're going to go all out on them and we know it's going to be a tough match.",7-8-2024 16:10,1723039800000
MIBR send struggling HEROIC to the lower bracket,https://www.hltv.org/news/39544/mibr-send-struggling-heroic-to-the-lower-bracket,"9z taught 3DMAX a harsh lesson in 13-3 and 13-4 wins on the B stream. MIBR beat HEROIC in their opening series at IEM Cologne under new in-game leader André ""drop"" Abreu. The Brazilian team won it 2-1 against a side clearly not at their best — particularly on the defense —, with Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk standing in for Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov, who could not travel to Germany due to visa issues. ""Things weren't going as we expected so we decided that it was time to make a change,"" MIBR's new leader said on the broadcast after the game. ""Everyone was hoping for it, so we made the change and we're trying our best to fit me, to fit exit into his new roles, to get comfortable and reach better results than we had in the past."" The next phase of the bracket is then set, with opening round losers 3DMAX and HEROIC set to face off in an elimination match and 9z taking on MIBR for a spot straight into the group stage. The series kicked off on Ancient, where the T sides tipped the scales as an 8-4 half in favor of MIBR was turned on its head after the switch and HEROIC posted a 9-2 score on the offensive to secure the map 13-10. Things were looking good for the Europeans as MIBR's 1-5 record on Mirage did not bode well for drop and his men. In the end, however, a 6-6 split in the first half went the way of the Brazilians, whose Felipe ""insani"" Yuji had a magnificent series throughout with AWPer Rafael ""saffee"" Costa also shining, as HEROIC's issues on the CT side were made apparent when they lost the half 1-7 to bow out 7-13. The same problems crept up on Anubis, a map that is hard to play on the CT side as is, and once again Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski and his men could not hold it down. Another split half gave way to a meltdown on the CT side and MIBR made it back-to-back 13-7s to close out the series. By the end of the series, HEROIC only tallied six CT rounds in three maps. Over on the B stream, much-fancied underdogs 9z put 3DMAX to the sword in 13-3 and 13-4 victories. La Violeta have recently moved to Madrid full-time, enabling the platform to build on recent results such as a top four at IEM Dallas and winning FiReLEAGUE Finals in Argentina. ""In Madrid it's been amazing, we love the weather, it's so hot,"" Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez said post-match. ""Practice here with the best teams in the world makes all the difference."" Star player Franco ""dgt"" Garcia was the key man on Anubis — prompting Lucas ""Bubzkji"" Andersen to call him the best prospect out of South America since Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato and Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos — but on Nuke it was the captain's time to shine. Clip: max wins a 1v2 clutch on Nuke The first half was already good, capped with a 1vs2 clutch just before the break, before max went foot to the floor with 14 frags in five CT rounds and a flashy triple spraydown to end the match 2-0. 3DMAX, who were late additions to the IEM Cologne team list after visa issues denied BetBoom, now drop to the lower bracket with plenty of improvement necessary after a humbling first day.",7-8-2024 17:28,1723044480000
"tabseN: ""You can see rigoN comes from an environment that had a family vibe""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39545/tabsen-you-can-see-rigon-comes-from-an-environment-that-had-a-family-vibe,"BIG have started IEM Cologne with a hard-fought win over FlyQuest, and tabseN spoke to HLTV about their entrance into the home event and their newest addition. BIG have gotten off to a shaky but successful start at IEM Cologne, eking out a win over FlyQuest in the opening round of the play-in to secure two chances to qualify for the group stage. It wasn't without growing pains, as the German side lost an overtime affair on Ancient and had to fight through two close maps on Inferno and Vertigo, nearly giving away a 10-0 lead on the decider. It is only their second tournament with their newest addition, Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi, who took David ""prosus"" Hesse' place on the roster in the off-season. The Swiss had a tough go in his debut at BLAST, but started off Cologne with a 1.21-rated performance in the series against the Australians. After their opening win, HLTV caught up with Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz to ask him about the new addition and how his aggressive style can complement a typically more controlled BIG side, and their start in Cologne. A 2-1 victory to start the tournament. How are you feeling, after such a close game where you were up 10-0? laughs I would say it was a tough game, but it's a positive sign that we are strong mentally, even though we had such a big lead and kind of threw it away. But they played pretty well, I would say. It just feels good to close it out. In the end, no one cares about the score, it's just about the W. Did you feel at any point that you were losing control of the game? Not really. I feel that we just didn't play our game at all, especially on Vertigo CT. We hadn't played Vertigo for a while. Overall, it was quite a good map for us and we didn't have the rhythm with rigoN yet. And I would say they took advantage of many holes in our setups. At some point, it kind of felt like we had lost control, but we were still kind of calm. I saw that Krimbo was waving at them in the first half, and then, in the second half, they began to do the same. There was a bit of banter going on, no? It's just love. Especially with them, they have really good humor, and it's really good to have these kind of people around. How important is it for the team to begin Cologne with a victory, given that you're a German team and this is one of the biggest tournaments of the year for you? Really important. Even though it doesn't really matter to us, it's the easier path, of course. For us, it's step by step. It's a really long tournament, and we're looking forward to having a lot of games. At BLAST, we just played against NAVI and we won against VP, so we want to show what we are capable of against other teams that are kind of at our level. We're looking forward to being in this tournament for a long time. This was a rematch of the Dallas game that you played against FlyQuest. Back then you also played Ancient and you won 13-6. Was there anything different about them this time around in your map pick? We were surprised they let Dust2 through. Usually, it's their perma-ban, so we were really confident they would ban Dust2 and prepared Ancient a lot, even though our CT side was kind of shaky, we lost some rounds we shouldn't have. They also played well, they found some holes, and it was really hard to play, especially when they were also trying to play the game and not just wait for mistakes. They did a good job on Ancient, for sure. rigoN seems to be getting more comfortable with each game. How are you feeling on the server? And do you think he is getting closer to what he can truly show for the team? Definitely, I'm really proud of him because he gives a lot of input. We had a bootcamp, and we're trying to implement him a lot in our system. Of course, he had a completely different way of playing the game. He was a really aggressive style of player, and we don't actually need that, but sometimes he can bring the spiciness. If he can just switch the control sometimes, do the spicy stuff and then play controlled, I think this will give us a lot of control in the game. His aim and his playstyle are also really threatening for the opponent team. Krimbo was saying in the pre-match interview that rigoN also brings that energy to the team that you were lacking a little bit. Definitely. He's a really positive guy. He brings a lot of hype, a lot of good vibes. He's not just individually skilled, he's also a really good teammate. He's laughing, he's trying to hype everyone up. You can see that he comes from an environment that had, like, a family vibe. This is also something I really look up to, and I'm glad he's now on my team. I'm hoping that we can achieve even more. You're now going to face SAW. You haven't played against them in a year. What are your expectations for this matchup? I'm really looking forward to playing against them. SAW are kind of like BIG. They're a team that isn't really on people's radars. They are underdogs most of the time and they also have the family vibes and stuff. So I'm looking forward to having a good game. I also have a good relationship with them, so I just wish them a good game. Not good luck, just a good game. I hope we can improve game by game. You are now one victory away from the group stage. What sort of expectations did you have heading into this tournament? My expectations were really clear: that we make it to the group stage, for sure.",7-8-2024 18:26,1723047960000
HEN1 joins RED Canids,https://www.hltv.org/news/39547/hen1-joins-red-canids,"The spirited AWPer formally joins coldzera's team after a brief period on Imperial's bench. RED Canids have announced the signing of Henrique ""HEN1"" Teles to their Counter-Strike roster on a loan from Imperial. The 29-year-old joins the team as a replacement for Wesley ""hardzao"" Lopes, who was benched in late July. HEN1 had sitting on the sidelines since June, when he was benched from Imperial despite being one of their strongest performers and later replaced by former 9z sniper Santino ""try"" Rigal. He didn't waste any time to find a new team as he joins forces with another Brazilian veteran, Marcelo ""coldzera"" David, for the first time in his over decade-long career just over a month after his benching. HEN1's addition to the RED Canids squad comes as somewhat of a surprise given that there already was an existing AWPer on the roster in the form of Gabriel ""nython"" Lino. But it appears that nython has given up the sniper for HEN1. In the team's ESL Challenger Atlanta South American qualifier matches, the new member was seen manning the Big Green — and topping the tournament's charts with a 1.31 rating while doing so, albeit to no avail as RED Canids finished runners-up to ODDIK. RED Canids have the following team: Marcelo ""coldzera"" David Gabriel ""nython"" Lino Carlos ""venomzera"" Eduardo David ""dav1deuS"" Tapia Maldonado Henrique ""HEN1"" Teles",7-8-2024 20:57,1723057020000
Eternal Fire outlast Falcons in messy Play-in start,https://www.hltv.org/news/39548/eternal-fire-outlast-falcons-in-messy-play-in-start,"The Turkish team barely closed out the Dust2 decider after punishing sloppy play from Snappi's side. Eternal Fire are one series away from securing a spot in the top-16 stage of IEM Cologne following a 2-1 victory (13-5 Vertigo, 8-13 Nuke, 13-11 Dust2) over Falcons in their opening match of the Play-in. Neither team delivered a convincing account of themselves and the series was filled with sloppy mistakes bailed out by individual highlights, culminating with a squandered round 24 on Dust2 where Falcons had the economy advantage but couldn't convert. The defeat casts Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's down to the lower bracket, where they will be heavy favorites against ALTERNATE aTTaX before facing the loser of BIG vs. SAW for a spot in the top-16. Engin ""MAJ3R"" Küpeli's side were in blistering form on Vertigo and converted their pick with ease (13-5) off the back of an otherworldly performance from Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş, but stumbled on Falcons' pick of Nuke. An early lead for the Saudi organization could have slipped away, but Eternal Fire squandered a retake after Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen snuck onto the lower site, awarding Snappi his first HLTV-recorded 1vs5 in his 11-year career. Falcons were unyielding in the second half, recovered from a pistol defeat by crunching Lobby, and used that momentum to close in on a map victory. Eternal Fire began a comeback effort, but tipped the gaff after a questionable drop out of Heaven in a 2vs2 offered Falcons an easy retake and allowed them to close the map out not long after. Dust2 was more contentious as Eternal Fire punished Falcons with Long and B splits, with Emil ""Magisk"" Reif's best efforts keeping Falcons in the running and helping recover near the end of the half. Snappi's side looked set to pull off a comeback in the second half with a better look on the attack, but a Özgür ""woxic"" Eker 1vs3 and shameful showing on round 24 left Falcons looking the fool as Eternal Fire narrowly edged out the win.",7-8-2024 21:10,1723057800000
"Liquid, FURIA claim victory in final day one games",https://www.hltv.org/news/39550/liquid-furia-claim-victory-in-final-day-one-games,"Twistzz's side was pushed the distance by paiN and nearly squandered substantial leads on Anubis and Inferno. Liquid and FURIA have secured wins in their opening match of the IEM Cologne Play-in stage, defeating paiN and Imperial, respectively, to set up a battle against one another for a spot in the top-16 stage. Liquid gave a good account of themselves at BLAST Fall Groups with back-to-back victories over world No.1 Natus Vincere, and with the atmosphere within the team looking renewed, they arrived in Cologne as favorites against a paiN on a 14-series winstreak. 17-year-old João ""snow"" Vinicius didn't miss a beat as he hit the server in hot form, but it wasn't enough to cool off a stellar T side effort from Liquid on Anubis as they led 9-3 at the break. That edge quickly dwindled after the side swap, however, as Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt called circles around Liquid's defenses and numerous man advantages were squandered by Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and company, allowing paiN to reach map point first, 12-10. The Brazilian team couldn't close out, however, and Liquid hit another gear after forcing overtime with a 3-0 sweep on the defense before closing out the map. Almost identical scenes unfolded on Inferno as another strong T side effort from Liquid saw them lead 9-3 at the break, only for a handful of clutches from Lucas ""nqz"" Soares and an incredible triple spraydown from biguzera bringing paiN back into the game. Aggression in Banana and a triple kill from Twistzz stopped the comeback early this time, however, and Liquid narrowly edged out the win 13-11 to deny a decider. FURIA were tasked with a Brazilian derby against Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo's former organization, Imperial, and it was a test they looked woefully underequipped to survive at the start of the series. Santino ""try"" Rigal proved worthy of replacing Henrique ""HEN1"" Teles as he imposed dominance over FURIA for much of Dust2, combining with an equally throttling performance out of Lucas ""decenty"" Bacelar that simply left FURIA no chance to respond. FURIA's 2-0 start on the map turned into a 3-13 defeat, with try and decenty mustering 2.18 and 2.22 ratings, respectively, and the latter finishing the map with a monstrous 160 ADR. Nuke devolved into utter chaos as the teams engaged in a force-buy war for the first eight rounds straight, with neither able to chain wins together until FURIA finally broke the streak off the back of an Imperial timeout. Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros stepped up in the final rounds of the half to grant his team the lead at halftime, but chaos ensued again after the side swap with force-buy wars and a back-and-forth allowing neither team to pull ahead. That battle went all the way to the finish line as FalleN's side narrowly edged out a 13-11 win, only for the final map of the series to end in a complete blowout as FURIA obliterated Imperial 13-0 on Inferno.",8-8-2024 00:02,1723068120000
joel denies cheating as Akros shares new details behind the ban,https://www.hltv.org/news/39549/joel-denies-cheating-as-akros-shares-new-details-behind-the-ban,"The company behind the anti-cheat that banned joel has revealed new details to HLTV about what it had allegedly detected. The Swede denies the claims. The Counter-Strike scene was taken by storm on Sunday when news broke that BC.Game player Joel ""joel"" Holmlund had been banned by third-party anticheat Akros ahead of his team's match against B8 in CCT Europe Series 7. This came after joel had long been a target of broad cheating and match-fixing accusations. In 2023, he was suspended by ESIC for seven months for placing bets on his own matches, though the watchdog stressed no conclusive evidence of match-fixing was found. When it came to joel's Akros ban, little was shared at the time about the nature of it other than the company behind the anti-cheat claiming there was ""zero chance"" that it was a false-positive occurrence. BC.Game had also stressed they had stayed ""in the dark"" about the details behind the ban while they launched their own investigation into the matter. But HLTV has now received more information from Akros about what was detected and when, and joel has also responded to the claims. According to 'Tristan C.', a representative from the Akros company, the ban occurred after joel launched the game through the anti-cheat less than 30 minutes before the match against B8 was scheduled to begin. The Swede was then prohibited from entering the server as a result before the match even began. The exact cheat that had allegedly been detected was not named, but the representative listed the following features of it: ""Features include ESP (a type of wallhack), Aimbot and Triggerbot.  Each feature has additional customization, for the aim assistance and triggerbot it can be customized to look more human-like and, if not configured poorly, would be completely invisible to the human eye.  Not all features need to be used, for example, a player might only use the Triggerbot or only use the Aimbot or only use the ESP."" The representative also shared it is a cheat anyone can purchase and that it is ""meant for competitive play on third party leagues and advertises Akros undetection status."" He further elaborated it is a ""bootkit"" type cheat that is launched before the operating system, and which can only be removed or unloaded by restarting the operating system at the bare minimum. Furthermore, he says the same cheat could have gone undetected in the past: ""The cheat could have been used before without being detected. The fact that we didn't detect its presence in matches prior to August 4 does not prove it wasn't present earlier, as this type of cheat is notoriously difficult to identify."" In a response to the ban in a comment to HLTV, joel has vehemently denied that he had cheated or that he had planned to do so, which the pre-emptive ban implies: ""I know I have not cheated or planned to do so,"" he said. ""I love to play the game. If I'm not playing CS2, I'm watching it to become better. To now have people doubting my legitimacy is the worst part. I've seen some people react to my demos; I don't mind if they look for something suspicious since everything I do in-game has its explanation. I've even seen some clips floating around that some say are ""sus,"" while there are Teamspeak recordings of information being said that I react on. ""What does hurt, though, is when people prematurely say I'm doing something suspicious in-game because they think I know where the enemy is in an unnatural way, saying I used radar hacks or any form of cheats, which is not true. Those that play with me in teams know that I have a vision of how to play the game, that I'm very vocal in-game, and that can easily be seen when talking to me about the game. There wouldn't be a reason for me to suddenly turn on cheats, but people don't look at it from different angles and just assume I'm a cheater. I've already proven myself on LAN, even though it was some time ago now, and I can replicate that performance."" When asked specifically whether he had a cheat loaded on his machine at the time of the ban, joel also responded negatively: ""No, I did not."" ""Makes no sense on why I would cheat now when I finally have received a chance to redeem myself. I am more driven than ever to play Counter-Strike and compete. My goal has been to reach the top level of the scene and thanks to all the resources I’ve been given in this team, it makes no sense for me to throw it all away by cheating."" joel did not have an explanation for why the ban might have been triggered and only declined the notion that it had anything to do with the latest update to the anti-cheat released on the same day he was banned, which introduced compatibility with the Memory Integrity setting on Windows. When asked about his further plans, joel stressed his intention to continue playing: ""I hope to resolve this matter since I've never cheated in a match, despite what some people claim. I still love to play the game, and I hope that's what I can continue to do in some way."" Overturning the ban doesn't look possible, however. The Akros representative shared that it is permanent and that joel won't be able to participate in any event or platform that is Akros-protected ever again. BC.Game also appear to be moving on from the controversial Swede. ""As it stands right now we are still in the dark on the truth of the situation and therefore our best course of action is that Joel will remain removed from the team,"" a statement the organization released on X reads. ""We are actively searching for a permanent replacement to maintain our competitive edge. We are dedicated to full transparency with our community and will provide an update on our current roster in the near future.""",7-8-2024 23:14,1723065240000
Metizport to BLAST Showdown as Johnny Speeds suffer another narrow miss,https://www.hltv.org/news/39551/metizport-to-blast-showdown-as-johnny-speeds-suffer-another-narrow-miss,"The Showdown's team list is now complete after Metizport won the Nordic qualifier. Metizport became the final team to qualify for the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown after securing first place in Pelaajat Nordic Masters Fall ahead teams such as Johnny Speeds, Sashi, BLEED and TSM. The Swedish side now has two weeks to prepare for the 16-team event, which has two BLAST Premier Fall Final spots on offer and features some tough opposition, including the likes of FaZe and Virtus.pro. The Nordic qualifier took place over the course of three days and saw the victors traverse a tough group stage from second place, where they suffered a loss to Johnny Speeds and narrowly passed BLEED in a triple-overtime affair. Nicolas ""Plopski"" Gonzalez Zamora and company went on to beat TSM after two overtimes in another closely-contested match, before they took revenge on Johnny Speeds in a one-sided final performance starring a 2.00-rated performance from Linus ""nilo"" Bergman. The grand final loss marked the second time the rising Johnny Speeds squad narrowly missed out on qualification for a top event within just three days. On Monday, the William ""draken"" Sundin-led side lost the BetBoom Dacha closed qualifier final to 9 Pandas after taking down the likes of fnatic and Cloud9 on the way to the decider.

"EliGE: ""We need to start becoming that team that is at minimum playoffs""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39546/elige-we-need-to-start-becoming-that-team-that-is-at-minimum-playoffs,"The North American star opened up about Complexity's struggles and what he hopes his team can achieve in Cologne. Complexity are one victory away from the group stage of IEM Cologne 2024 after beating world No.96 ALTERNATE aTTaX 2-0, setting up a match against the winner of Eternal Fire vs. Falcons in the next round. The North American team traveled to Germany after a widly mixed showing in the BLAST Premier Fall Group. They got off on the wrong foot, losing to an AWPer-less HEROIC, but improved as the tournament went on and played out competitive series against Spirit and Natus Vincere. For Complexity, 2024 has been a disappointing year. The ESL Challenger Jönköping title is not enough to ease the pain of all those playoff misses, with Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski admitting that his team needs to make more deep runs. ""We need to start becoming that team that's at minimum playoffs, start showing that we're a top-10 team or we deserve to be a top-10 team in the world,"" he told HLTV. The 27-year-old rued the mistakes that keep costing Complexity but said there are ""a lot of good things"" to take from their recent BLAST matches. ""We're making it harder for other teams to play against us. So, we definitely have things that we can build off of in a positive way, from the BLAST Groups and continuing here."" A 2-0 victory to start off the tournament. I guess the second map was closer than many expected. Was it harder than you expected? I think it's about in line with what we expected, being like the overdogs in the series. I think that we were in control of most of the game for both maps, honestly. It's just that we lost both pistols on Anubis, and we could've even had a better game on Inferno. But yeah, I think it was in line with expectations. I wanted to ask you about one specific moment on Inferno, where hallzerk won that 1v5, and then the next round you almost lost to an eco. Was it like a reflection of the team's current struggles, where you are making some mistakes in some very basic stuff, something that you and T.c. have talked about? Where every game feels like a grind sometimes. It definitely does. In this situation, I feel like, in the first half, the 5v3s we were losing were a little bit more symbolic of that. I think we have a lot of talented players that can pull off some really good rounds and make a lot of crazy stuff happen, like that 1v5 from hallzerk, which was really nice. But it's more about us just being more comfortable with letting the enemies make mistakes, is what I think it is. Because a lot of the rounds, if we just tuck into a corner, play off contact and just let the round happen when we're in these advantages, then we're going to win them more often. We have to keep working on that. It has been a rough start to the season for the team. Results haven't always gone your way, but it feels, at least from the outside, that there is some tension in the team. I could tell whether it was ALTERNATE aTTaX or you winning a round because they were getting so loud. In your team, it doesn't seem that anyone is lifting the team up and trying to bring everyone up when you're going through some struggles. Do you feel that way? Well, I think that it's just hard because we've just been having a really tough year. I think that overall, results aren't what we would want from ourselves. We're not making the playoffs in a lot of these tournaments and we're losing out in groups. So that just doesn't feel good. And we need to build back up to that. And, you know, we don't have a ton of super-hype guys that are doing speeches or anything like that. But I think that we just need to keep on building slowly. We need to work on our fundamentals and secure more of the rounds that are definitely in our hands, where if we just play the time and play the round correctly, then we're going to win them. And then we're going to start feeling better because, you know, when you lose so many heartbreaking rounds, per game, per tournament… Like, it feels that in almost every series, there are a billion heartbreakers that are, like, 'Wow, how did we just lose that?' type feelings. Then it's definitely mentally draining. We need to work on that, and that's when it's going to get better. Do you think this is the right tournament to build up some momentum for the rest of the season? I definitely hope so. I think it was nice that we had such an advantage in our first series where we can build the rounds back where we can feel more confident. Especially in these first two maps that we played, I think there were a lot of good rounds that we can highlight. And it's not super stressed where we can feel out how it feels in the round and identify what's making these mistakes happen, what we need to work on specifically. And it's just a little bit less pressure, so it kind of makes it easier to diagnose what exactly we should be fixing, if that makes sense. We have so many rounds to work on for examples, but I think it's just nice in a tournament when you can get those reps in where everyone is feeling how it should, man advantages are working out for us and we're winning the rounds cleanly, not giving up a bunch of advantages. So as the tournament progresses, we obviously want to keep going with that. It's nice that the bracket is double elimination. We're already through the first game. And then we have another one tomorrow. And we need to just keep building. Hopefully, we win that one and we can have a good start to the actual tournament. You had a rough start to the BLAST Groups. You lost to HEROIC, who had a stand-in, won the next two series, took a map off Spirit and had a close map against NAVI. What lessons did you learn from that tournament? The biggest lesson to me is just making sure when we're in the man advantages that we need to play the fundamentals better because we're just making a lot of really basic mistakes consistently and that has been a thing for like a long time now, but I think identifying the problem and the solution is that we need to just play more calmly in the situations and just go back to the basics. We don't have to peek too much in these situations, we can let the rounds come to us. Especially when we're in a lot of these advantage rounds or we're like the overdog of the series. Whatever it is, if we're in the advantage and there's not a lot of pressure on us, we can just let the other team make the mistakes. Like they have to prove that they can know, win the side, or play a long round, whatever it is. So I think that's the main identification from my side of what we need to work on. But as you can see, we have so many really good rounds that we can play. We have tons of high highs, a lot of low lows, and that's pretty much been the story for a while, and we need to keep working on what I just said about making sure that we're not messing up our fundamentals and playing calmly in these high-pressure rounds, and just build off of that momentum. And from losing to HEROIC with a stand-in to taking a map off Spirit: Were you happy that the team was able to bounce back? Yeah, I'm definitely happy that we showed a really good face in those games. We should have beaten NAVI in the first game. We beat Spirit in the opener game on Dust2. So there are a lot of good things to take away from it. And it's looking better for our map pool because before… You know, it's difficult when you're only getting wins on Vertigo. So getting that win against Spirit, showing good rounds on Anubis… We're making it harder for other teams to play against us.  So, we definitely have things that we can build off of in a positive way, from the BLAST Groups and continuing here. What sort of expectations did you have heading into this tournament? What would you be satisfied with? For me, I would just be satisfied making it to the playoffs. That has been the bare minimum goal for me, especially considering how the start of the year went, where we were not even making it to playoffs. So I think just realigning expectations… We haven't been that consistent semi-final team since the beginning of CS2. And now we need to go back to the basics, make sure we're not losing these 5v3s, 5v2s, and get into the playoffs. Because I haven't been to the playoffs of Cologne for a while. I would love to go there. I would love for the guys to experience that as well. Because it's an incredible stage. And the fans are always amazing. And, yeah, I think it would be great to have that experience. One of the main talking points about your team after the recent struggles is that maybe the team needs a change, maybe the team needs to bring in someone new. Are you still confident that this roster can compete at the highest level? It always looks bad when you have been with a team for a long time and the results aren't getting better or they stagnate or get worse, which is obviously the worst possible conclusion from any type of roster. But I think we have a lot of really positive things going for the team. We have these players that can just make crazy highlights happen, really good mechanics, good reads. I think we have a good macro. We have a lot of things that are going for us, and we have to show results at the end of the day. So we need to start becoming that team that's at minimum playoffs, start showing that we're a top-10 team or we deserve to be a top-10 team in the world. And, if we can't do that, then that is proof enough if, like, by the end of the year, we can't make that happen. Because it's not enough to, you know, just show up to tournaments and just be happy like losing last place or second-to-last place. That's not fun for anyone. No competitor would be satisfied with that. But I think that we have the pieces that can do that. And now it's up to us as individuals and as a team to work on the problems that we have to make it happen.",8-8-2024 00:15,1723068900000
"FalleN: ""We're really focused on getting to the playoffs""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39553/fallen-were-really-focused-on-getting-to-the-playoffs,"The Brazilian AWPer and IGL says that going further than at EWC would be the dream goal. FURIA passed their first test in the Play-In stage of IEM Cologne as they beat fellow Brazilian side Imperial 2-1 in a series where they had to come back from a map down. This is the second tournament of the season for FURIA after the Esports World Cup. In Riyadh, the Brazilians managed to reach the quarter-finals, and Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo is hoping for another playoff appearance to end the Cologne ""curse"" for his team, which has never made it out of the groups at the German event. After the victory against Imperial, FalleN sat down with HLTV to discuss the messy opening series, the preparation for Cologne and the goals for the German event. FalleN, a 13-0 to wrap up the series. There was no better way to end it, right? It was very important for us, a game that gives us confidence and that showed the team's resilience during the series, right? On the first map, even though it ended 13-3, a lot of rounds were close. I think they were more warmed up than us for that first game. Nuke was very tense, it could have gone either way, there were a lot of force-buy wins from both teams. It was a rollercoaster. And the third map, it was a blowout victory, we played very well. Were you surprised with Imperial's strong start on Dust2, or did you expect a tough game? Strategically, I was a little bit surprised because they played a bit differently than what they had been doing in Brazil. They were contesting catwalk a lot, and I think was different from what we had in mind. But I think we didn't play well on Dust2, while they played really well. And there were some rounds where two players were left alive in three or four rounds, so they were able to capitalize on that. But I think it was a good game anyway. It's not easy to recover from a 13-3 loss. Would you say the team is stronger mentally now? Absolutely. Absolutely. We try to take good care of the team spirit, of our mental game, so that we don't lose the match even before it starts. Sometimes, it can happen. I have been on teams where the mental factor ended up hindering the team's evolution in certain moments. And on this team, we are trying to be careful with that, it's hard to come back from a 13-3 loss like the one on Dust2. It's hard, it's a blow, it's like you're in the ring and you go down in the first round. But you have to pick yourself up and get over it. You have to keep believing because you cannot lose to yourself. These domestic matchups between two teams that know each other very well, where there's a big rivalry, can be unpredictable sometimes. If you analyze everything that went down, are you pleased with your team's performance? I am pleased, yes. A win is a win, and there's no way to be sad. We will obviously look at Dust2 and understand what we could have done better. And there will certainly be some things to analyze on Nuke as well. There is not going to be much to talk about regarding Inferno, I think our opponent really felt our streak of rounds, we were able to do everything we wanted to do and we won every situation. But I'm super pleased with the way that the team played today and the fact that no one let the frustration of losing a map get to them in the other games. This is very important, and we are happy that we were able to do it today. Nuke seemed to be a very comfortable map for you at EWC. Did you expect such a close game today? It was a very weird game, right? When you play a game where the first seven rounds are back-and-forth, back-and-forth, you end up having to use all your creativity to try and surprise the opponent, right? But credit to Imperial, too, they were playing well. There were some things that we messed up executing. It wasn't a clean game on our part, but that's the way it is. When you're in a game, you have to get it done somehow. What was the preparation for this event like? What did you focus on during your time here in Europe after coming back from Saudi Arabia? We focused on some new things and we tried to fix some things that we did wrong in the EWC playoffs. We're starting to have more practice time with chelo and skullz. chelo was very sick before EWC so he couldn't practice for some days, and now we had two full weeks of practice with him. We're trying to improve the team as a whole and understand how to play and adapt to each other. Fixing problems in CS is about finding solutions. You just said on Gaules' stream that you want to break that Cologne curse, since this hasn't historically been a good tournament for FURIA. How far do you hope to go here? We are really focused on getting to the playoffs. Our philosophy right now is 'one more step each time if possible.' So for us, it would be very important to make it to the semi-finals since we were in the quarter-finals in our last tournament. And once the tournament reaches the playoffs, anything can happen. I have won this tournament a few times. And looking at the current level of CS, even the best teams, the favorites, can lose any match. It's super tight. The teams that are trying to get to the top are as strong as the ones that are already there. So it's going to be tough, we will try to make it to the semi-finals. That would be our dream goal. And if we can win the whole thing, why not? We will try to go as far as possible. Right now, looking at the favorites, I'd say only a few people would believe that FURIA can make it to the playoffs. Do you think you can take advantage of that underdog status to get some upsets? I can't say what other teams think about us, I believe that, after the recent changes, some of the concepts they have about our team are probably changing. FURIA has always had this style, has always had this eccentric way of playing that has been difficult to deal with on many occasions. I myself played against this team many times and I suffered a lot with arT's ideas, with the constant aggressiveness and the way they did things. But FURIA now has a new line-up, a new captain, and I believe that this concept of FURIA is gradually changing. I don't know what they think about us. We're just going to go in, do the best we can, and try to improve every day. I believe that if a team doesn't take us seriously, they'll be in trouble. We're playing good CS, we have ideas of what to do, and I believe that the way CS is today, you can't not take anyone seriously. The top teams have to thoroughly analyze what other teams are doing and have to put great thought into every match-up because it's very balanced.",8-8-2024 11:53,1723110780000
degster lands in Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39552/degster-lands-in-cologne,"After a slew of visa issues, degster returns to HEROIC's lineup in time for their second match at IEM Cologne. Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov has landed in Cologne and will be ready to play for HEROIC in their second match in the tournament against 3DMAX, the organization has announced. The Russian AWPer has finally resolved visa issues that saw him miss their seasonal debut at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups and the first day of IEM Cologne. HEROIC struggled without the 23-year-old as they first suffered losses to Spirit and Complexity in Copenhagen with coach Eetu ""sAw"" Saha playing, and then also failed to make it past MIBR in their opener in Cologne, where Monte's benched AWPer Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk stood in. The European team will now attempt to recover the losses with their permanent AWPer back in the saddle, starting with the match against the Frenchmen, who came in as a last-minute replacement for BetBoom and were no match for 9z in the opening round. HEROIC will require two consecutive wins to make it to the group stage, with the loser of the match between FURIA vs. Liquid also in their path should they pass their first test against 3DMAX.",8-8-2024 12:00,1723111200000
"OG bench k1to, Buzz to trial for the team",https://www.hltv.org/news/39555/og-bench-k1to-buzz-to-trial-for-the-team,"The never-ending shuffle at OG continues as they make their third change in as many months. OG have announced the decision to move Nils ""k1to"" Gruhne to the inactive roster and the addition of Christian ""Buzz"" Andersen to the team on a trial basis. The German leaves the active roster after a year of service, during most of which he acted as OG's in-game leader following the departure of Nemanja ""nexa"" Isaković last November. A change was on the cards after his leadership duties were stripped away at the beginning of the new season, when Thomas ""Thomas"" Utting first stepped in for the BLAST Groups and former MOUZ NXT member Christoffer ""Chr1zN"" Storgaard was later officially unveiled as the team's new IGL. ""After a challenging season, we're making the decision to move k1to to the inactive roster. We are grateful for his commitment and for taking on the in-game leader role when it was needed most,"" a statement from OG reads. With Buzz chosen as k1to's replacement, OG make another young addition to a squad now averaging just over 20 years old. Best known for his time with Astralis, the 21-year-old Dane recently played a brief stint with Entropiq, which came to an abrupt end after the Czech organization decided to pull the plug on their European roster in the aftermath of the removal of open qualifiers for the Major. According to OG, the new addition will join the team at a bootcamp starting next week, where the new squad will begin preparations for the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown and Perfect World Shanghai Major's closed qualifier, which will take place later this month. OG's lineup is now the following: Maciej ""F1KU"" Miklas Bram ""Nexius"" Campana Mădălin-Andrei ""MoDo"" Mirea Christoffer ""Chr1zN"" Storgaard Christian ""Buzz"" Andersen (trial) Lambert ""Lambert"" Prigent (coach) Nils ""k1to"" Gruhne (benched)",8-8-2024 15:29,1723123740000
SAW secure a spot in the group stage; FlyQuest sent home,https://www.hltv.org/news/39556/saw-secure-a-spot-in-the-group-stage-flyquest-sent-home,"BIG and The MongolZ will play decider matches on Friday. SAW are the first team to punch their ticket to the IEM Cologne group stage from the play-in. The Portuguese team secured their spot in a three-map series which ended in an Inferno nailbiter that went to the final round of regulation. ""For me and MUTiRiS it's an insane feeling,"" Ricardo ""roman"" Oliveira told the broadcast after the match when asked about it taking a decade for them to make it to IEM Cologne. ""Age is just a number if you believe and you have the right teammates,"" he continued. ""Most of this is because of the three kids we have on the team. They're so good, so thanks to them and just keep believing."" The series came down to an Inferno decider, one of Counter-Strike's classics, after the two teams stole each other's map pick one-sidedly. A massive CT-side on Anubis gave BIG the 1-0 lead, which was in turn given over to SAW who dominated Ancient. BIG took a large lead on the T side in the  decider after winning the second round forcebuy, but SAW came alive with three rounds on the trot before the switch to make it a 5-7 half. Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes and company were then the ones who set the pace when it was their turn to attack with slow, methodical play, until BIG found their footing on the defense by stopping a fast A play through apartments. The final map of the series became a game of inches all the way to the final round of regulation, when João ""story"" Vieira — who'd had a very quiet showing on Inferno until then — got three kills, including a 1vs2 clutch, in a post-plant defense to drag it over the line, 13-11. In the elimination match on the A stream, The MongolZ picked up a statement victory in what was a confirmation of their dominance over the APAC region. FlyQuest put up a fight on Anubis, but with the usually reliable Joshua ""INS"" Potter off his mark and Christopher ""dexter"" Nong having to pick up the pieces, the Mongolians still secured a comfortable victory off the back of a strong defensive half. A beatdown on Ancient followed as The MongolZ lost both pistol rounds and still came away with a 13-4 victory. They were given all the space they needed to work with in B lane and toyed around with their opponents all throughout an 11-1 offensive half.",8-8-2024 16:39,1723127940000
"dexter: ""Three tournaments in a row, it's clear that something's not working""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39557/dexter-three-tournaments-in-a-row-its-clear-that-somethings-not-working,"The Australian IGL opened up about FlyQuest's issues after his team bombed out of IEM Cologne in last place. FlyQuest have been sent packing from IEM Cologne's Play-In stage in last place following a 0-2 defeat to The MongolZ in the lower bracket. It was the third tournament in a row where the Australian team was eliminated without picking up a victory, after IEM Dallas and the Esports World Cup. Before the match, head coach Erdenetsogt ""erkaSt"" Gantulga had already expressed concern about the team's shaky CT sides, and those issues were laid bare against the Mongolians as FlyQuest posted just four rounds on the defense across the series. Speaking to HLTV after the match, Christopher ""dexter"" Nong said that the team's T sides are the only positive he can take from this tournament. ""People are doing the right things on the T side and the communication is really good. But I think it's just a huge weakness to have a different mentality coming into CT."" He added: ""Maybe it's synchronization or just reps, but basically it didn't really translate into any kills or we're not taking enough risks. Probably me in the role position I am in, I'm always trying to take the most risk, but it's going to be a bit too predictable. So I don't think it's too consistent to do. ""I think we're just playing too passively and need to just play how CS2 is designed. And that's just be a total idiot and swing wide, because that's what every other team's doing. Make it easier for ourselves."" There were some encouraging signs from the Australian team in their first tournaments under FlyQuest as they finished top-eight at IEM Chengdu and top-12 in ESL Pro League 19. But this string of early tournament exits will force dexter to make some adjustments. ""Maybe hopes got too high or something like that or we're just a bit more shelled up,"" he said. ""I'm not really too sure. We'll just have to look at it, maybe work in a different way. Three tournaments in a row, it's clear that something is not working. So we're going to have to rethink a few things."" Next up on the calendar is ESL Pro League 20, a studio tournament with a lot less pressure riding on it. According to dexter, the preparation for the event will start with an internal discussion about roles and the approach to the game. ""Hopefully I can get the guys a bit more energetic, pushing things, risking more and making more mistakes,"" he said about EPL. ""Because right now, there's a lack of that. ""Right now, it's just to go back on our trajectory. After Chengdu, we were on an upward trajectory, coming into EPL and whatnot. And then even pratice and scrims were really good. But yeah, these last three tournaments are not a good look. We need to find what's comfortable for us and how we want to play a little bit better. Because, yeah, things change too much.""",8-8-2024 17:06,1723129560000
Liquid beat FURIA to make Cologne group stage,https://www.hltv.org/news/39558/liquid-beat-furia-to-make-cologne-group-stage,"The new-look squad extends their unbeaten run with their new roster to five series in a row. Liquid are through to the top-16 stage of IEM Cologne after securing a reverse-sweep victory over FURIA in the upper bracket of the Play-in. The Brazilian team was well-prepared for Liquid's Anubis pick and romped to victory off the back of a stellar individual effort from Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos, but couldn't convert on Nuke and ran out of gas on the Mirage decider, where Liquid secured a comfortable win to earn their group stage ticket. ""The resilience of this team is night-and-day compared to last team, and maybe even other iterations of Liquid,"" Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken said in a post-match interview. ""We're very strong in what we believe in and the way that we try to play, and I feel like we're never out of the game. ""In terms of losing Anubis, clearly they had this in their pocket for a while and they used it at the right time, but yeah, really happy. I knew that once we started CT Nuke that I have some T rounds to show and I can finally call on this map, and also on T side Mirage. It's kind of fun to show the world our map pool."" FURIA have one remaining chance to advance in the lower bracket, where they will face the winner of HEROIC vs. 3DMAX in hopes of making it to the group stage of Cologne for the first time since 2022. Liquid were punished on their Anubis pick and struggled to halt FURIA's aggression for much of the first half, going down 1-7 and barely salvaging three rounds by the break.  A pistol win and conversion helped close the gap, but yuurih and FURIA had done their homework and gave Liquid no window into the map, putting it to bed 13-8. That momentum continued on Nuke as FURIA jumped out to a 5-0 lead on the T side, but excellent reads from Twistzz and multi-fragging from Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak tore apart FURIA's executes and defaults as Liquid won seven in a row back. The Polish AWPer was key in kicking that recovery effort off with a triple kill and 1vs1 clutch, and he remained a stalwart presence in the second half to help Liquid reach map point, 12-8, before Twistzz and Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis won a 3vs5 in round 24 to force a decider. Liquid shifted up a gear on Mirage, stamping their authority with a flawless eight-round streak thanks to Justin ""jks"" Savage and Keith ""NAF"" Markovic's consistency anchoring both ends of the map leaving YEKINDAR and ultimate free to roam and gain early advantages. FURIA stopped the bleeding near the end of the half and came dangerously close to stealing the lead away in the second half, but a 2vs4 recovery by jks and ultimate swung momentum the other way, and a subsequent 3vs5 win by Liquid took any remaining wind out of the Brazilian team's sails as the series was brought to a quick end.",8-8-2024 19:24,1723137840000
HEROIC eliminate 3DMAX upon degster's return,https://www.hltv.org/news/39559/heroic-eliminate-3dmax-upon-degsters-return,"3DMAX were too profligate with man-advantages on the latter two maps. HEROIC have ensured the return of Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov was a happy occasion by taking down 3DMAX 2-1, recovering from a tough loss on Anubis (5-13) by winning Ancient (13-7) and Nuke (13-7) comfortably. With their victory HEROIC have secured a shot at qualifying for the group stage against FURIA, whilst 3DMAX are eliminated from the competition. HEROIC have been plagued by degster's visa issues since he joined the team, and it was no different on the first day of IEM Cologne Play-in as they were bested by MIBR with Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk serving as a stand-in. Rather than degster's return, however, it was the improved performance of Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck that was the real difference maker against 3DMAX. The Dane was woeful on the first day of play, but was in fine form on the T side of this series, which is where HEROIC did their best work. 3DMAX, a last-minute replacement in Cologne, certainly helped HEROIC's cause with the number of man-advantage scenarios they squandered across the series. Time and time again the Frenchmen overextended whilst searching in the mid-round, and time and time again they were punished for it. 3DMAX ended last season with some stellar form online, and began this one with a LAN victory at Skyesports Championship 2024, so they will be disappointed not only with failing to capitalise on said form in Germany, but also the manner in which it happened. The French squad were easily beaten in four of the five maps they played, and at least against HEROIC, it was largely their own doing.",8-8-2024 19:40,1723138800000
IEM Cologne Play-in day 2 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39554/iem-cologne-play-in-day-2-as-it-happened,"Just not a fantastic game of Counter-Strike from Falcons against a team barely inside the top 100. Falcons started very slowly on the opening map but recovered with a fine T side, until they nearly choked it away at the end. On Mirage they were a tad more comfortable, but there were still moments of sloppy play that cost them very winnable rounds, and they were again slow to close in the face of a potential comeback. Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García was a none factor for much of the series, his form continues to be far short of his peak, whilst Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer also had a few shaky moments mechanically, but the rest of the team were at least fragging to a decent level. However, if Falcons play to this sort of standard moving forward, they will be lucky to win another series. That couldn't have gotten any closer. Eternal Fire's rotations and reactions in man-disadvantages, paired with some misplays and unlucky timings from Complexity, almost allowed the Turkish team to gain the lead and force a decider. Eternal Fire capitalized on mistakes by Complexity to recover a 2vs4, and almost did the same in the next round as Complexity almost let a 5vs3 slip only to get bailed out by a 1vs2 by Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou. ALTERNATE aTTaX 6-9  Falcons Just get me out, please end this series. The story of the series has really been Falcons just about manage enough good or decent rounds to cover for their atrocious ones. Complexity 17-17  Eternal Fire Complexity 15-16  Eternal Fire A third map looked likely for a minute, but a perfect B execute and excellent entries from Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski and Michael ""Grim"" Wince has given Complexity another chance to close in two. ALTERNATE aTTaX 4-7  Falcons Falcons are taking control of the map overall, but it's still a bit of a mess most rounds. Complexity 14-15  Eternal Fire ALTERNATE aTTaX 3-4  Falcons In case it wasn't obvious, this map has been very messy so far. The Germans just lost back-to-back 5v3 advantages, which has given Falcons the advantage. Complexity 13-12  Eternal Fire Complexity 12-12  Eternal Fire Squandered opportunity after squandered opportunity, an overpeek here, a near miss there, and suddenly we're in overtime. ALTERNATE aTTaX 2-2  Falcons Man Falcons really haven't been inspiring confidence with their play this series. We've seen some woeful individual moments, but this one was a team effort. Complexity 12-9  Eternal Fire Complexity 12-8  Eternal Fire Complexity 11-8  Eternal Fire Five in a row from Complexity with some excellent aggression thwarting Eternal Fire's defaults, and they're now just two rounds from closing the series. Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou has come up huge with some multi-kills in defense of A and has moved up to second on the scoreboard for Complexity, but it isn't over yet — Eternal Fire just tallied their first round on the attack and the economy is broken for JT's side. ALTERNATE aTTaX 11-13  Falcons After a slow start Falcons began to take control of the map, cruising up to 12 rounds relatively comfortably. Then ALTERNATE aTTaX, seemingly realising their timid approach wasn't going to cut it, made a string of crazy plays to give themselves a chance at OT. Falcons managed to get things over the line, but that was still not a convincing performance overall. At least the majority-Danish side have their own map, Mirage, up next. Complexity 6-6  Eternal Fire Complexity started down 1-4, but much like on Vertigo, showed late signs of life after they were spurred on by an incredible 1vs2 ace clutch from Michael ""Grim"" Wince that converted a half-buy. The 23-year-old has come under fire for his recent performances but is trying to make a case for himself here with a 16-7 K-D at the break, although some of his multi-kills were squandered by Complexity with Eternal Fire keeping the game at even keel. ALTERNATE aTTaX 10-12  Falcons Falcons seemed ready to stroll over the finish line, but ALTERNATE aTTaX are making some crazy plays now... ALTERNATE aTTaX 9-12  Falcons Complexity 2-4  Eternal Fire ALTERNATE aTTaX 7-10  Falcons ALTERNATE aTTaX are either showing too much respect, or simply play too timid a CT side. The Germans have saved far too often, giving up winnable or at least contestable rounds, and they have psyched themselves out into over rotating in at least one scenario. Falcons are putting in a solid and workmanlike performance so far on offense, but it is being made relatively simple for them. Falcons 5-7  ALTERNATE aTTaX Falcons were poor early in this half. The A defense was woeful, they lost far too many duels, and only Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković seemed to have turned up ready to play. Marcel ""hyped"" Köhn was having his way with the far more experienced side. A timely tactical pause and some more proactive work on the CT side allowed Falcons to recover the score somewhat. What a disastrous second half from Eternal Fire, and one they will surely be kicking themselves for heading into Complexity's Dust2 pick. The Turks were 8-3 up before the break, but squandered a 3vs1 to Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski in the second pistol and never got back on the horse after that. EliGE was simply unstoppable in the second half and crushed Eternal Fire round after round for a ten-round spree, with an immediate answer to Eternal Fire's first win bringing the map to an immediate end. Falcons 2-5  ALTERNATE aTTaX Falcons' CT side was threatening to get away from them, their economy was in the dumps, but a proactive force-buy has given them some room to work with. Falcons 1-2  ALTERNATE aTTaX Oh dear Falcons. Complexity 6-8  Eternal Fire Complexity 4-8  Eternal Fire This hasn't been a pretty half for those who are fans of Complexity. Eternal Fire's teamplay, combined with crisp entries from Ali ""Wicadia"" Haydar Yalçın and Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş, butchered Complexity's defenses repeatedly. Complexity didn't look convincing at all on the CT side and it felt like Eternal Fire had the pick of the litter every round, with Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery's clutch being the sole saving grace for the American team as the swap to the attack. Complexity 2-3  Eternal Fire HEROIC were ultimately comfortable in that series after struggling on Anubis. 3DMAX's proactive defense ensured smooth sailing on the first map, but they were too profligate on man-advantage scenarios throughout the rest of the series, over-searching time and time again. HEROIC meanwhile were excellent in late-round situations and clutches. Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov had a relatively quiet series, nothing bad but nothing special, whilst Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck was far improved compared to his tough day yesterday. HEROIC 9-5  3DMAX HEROIC have also denied the follow up force-buy, which leaves them inches away from victory. 3DMAX 5-7  HEROIC 3DMAX were punished in that half for the same mistakes as the previous map, over-searching in man-advantage scenarios. A good T side has HEROIC favoured to take this Nuke. The comeback came close, but back-to-back 2vs4 and 3vs5 recoveries ensured Liquid wouldn't fumble their lead as they closed out the Mirage decider. It's an unbeaten run of five series victories in a row for the new-look Liquid, while FURIA drop to the lower bracket and will face the winner of HEROIC vs. 3DMAX for a final chance to advance. FURIA 7-11  Liquid FURIA 7-10  Liquid A mirror of Nuke as FURIA are rapidly closing the gap, but this time Liquid are struggling to even contest for rounds. Missed Window smokes probably aren't helping.... 3DMAX 0-3  HEROIC HEROIC have earned a strong start on the T half of Nuke, finding the entries and converting accordingly. 3DMAX haven't had a sniff yet. FURIA 3-9  Liquid Still a strong half for Liquid, but not the end they would have wanted. FURIA finally tallied their first round by converting a half-buy B execute and added another to their tally in the next, but that looked like all they would walk away due to this timely flank by Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis in round 12. But... well, just take a look at what happened. FURIA 0-8  Liquid This map has been start and stop with several technical pauses interspersed by tactical pauses from FURIA, but nothing has managed to break Liquid's momentum yet. Justin ""jks"" Savage and Keith ""NAF"" Markovic are anchoring efficiently, leaving Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis and Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak free to aggress and leave FURIA no opening. Their closest attempt came in the round below, but a clutch from NAF kept Liquid's clean sheet. 3DMAX 7-13  HEROIC Too many man-up scenarios were thrown away by 3DMAX on their T side. Otherwise, with their slick bombsite takes, the Frenchmen might have been able to seal this series in two. Flanks were unaccounted for a mid-rounds were too panicked. All credit to HEROIC for capitalizing, they have now forced the series to the decider of Nuke. 3DMAX 6-9  HEROIC 3DMAX have given themselves a chance to close the series in two, winning their T pistol and converting to drag the score much closer. HEROIC will get their first full buy of the half now, so the next round will be key. 3DMAX 3-9  HEROIC HEROIC's T side was too good for 3DMAX there, they shut down the French side's proactivity and clutched up when needed. The duo of René ""TeSeS"" Madsen and Guy ""NertZ"" Iluz cracked open plenty of rounds for their side, and HEROIC fully capitalized. During the break between Nuke and Mirage, ESL aired a teaser for a new documentary series, ""Live Legendary,"" with the first episode focusing on Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and premiering during IEM Cologne. FURIA 11-13  Liquid Liquid had four chances to close and required every one of those opportunities, with fantastic anchoring on A by Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros and multi-kills from Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos in Yard nearly allowing FURIA to pull things back to overtime. Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis and Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken halted the train ahead of the final stop, however, recovering a 3vs5 in round 24 to narrowly steal the Brazilian team's map pick and force a Mirage decider. 3DMAX 0-3  HEROIC Things looked a little dicey after HEROIC won the pistol, but a 2v4 was turned on its head to ensure a strong start for the European combine. FURIA 8-12  Liquid A half-buy from Liquid paid off and got them back to winning ways, and back-to-back slow defaults put them on map point. Four chances to close now. FURIA 8-9  Liquid Worrying signs for Liquid now as repeated force-buys aren't bearing fruit, with FURIA now just one round from a tie game. 3DMAX 13-5  HEROIC Relatively comfortable work for the Frenchmen, once Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck's early hot streak cooled off. The Danish rifler had 15 kills half-way through the first half, but once his entries dried up, Thomas ""Djoko"" Pavoni and Filip ""Graviti"" Brankovic took over. Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov's AWP struggled to get into the game, something HEROIC will be hoping changes as we move into their map pick. FURIA 6-8  Liquid FURIA 5-8  Liquid FURIA 5-7  Liquid That's more like the Liquid we expected to see. A downtrodden atmosphere in Liquid coming into Nuke made worse by a 0-5 start, but excellent rotational play and his confidence to make plays has proved the catalyst in a strong recovery effort. 3DMAX 7-5  HEROIC After a back and forth battle, Thomas ""Djoko"" Pavoni and Filip ""Graviti"" Brankovic came alive late to provide 3DMAX a winning effort on the unfavoured defensive half. FURIA 5-3  Liquid Liquid have turned things around off the back of a half-buy, grabbing their first courtesy of a triple kill and clutch from Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak. A flashy quad from Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken in the next ensured that the effort wasn't all for naught, and now the gap is closing. FURIA 5-0  Liquid I don't think even they could believe their eyes when they completely circumvented Liquid through the A main smoke. FURIA 4-0  Liquid No Nuke shenanigans like last time when FURIA played against Imperial and the forcebuys went back and forth. They survive the pistol round conversions and begin to drive off into the distance 3DMAX 0-2  HEROIC 3DMAX had a great opportunity to win the all-important CT pistol round on Anubis, but were torn apart by Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck who downed four players in a 2vs5 situation to get his team ahead. There's no discussion about who the player of the map was. FURIA 13-8  Liquid The Brazilians did most of the job on the Terrorist side but didn't have too much trouble closing it once on CT. More impact from Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos, who grabbed another clutch on the way to the opening map win. Things got a bit awkward towards the end as FURIA threw away a 5v3, but all was forgiven when they stole the final round away from Liquid's hands: SAW 13-11  BIG João ""story"" Vieira, who was having a quiet showing on Inferno, came alive in the third round, getting the final three frags in a 4vs3 defense in an afterplant situation on B to edge past BIG in the last round of regulation. FURIA 9-3  Liquid Liquid ended the half with a round to their name but it might just be too little, too late against a scorching hot Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos, who dominated on the T side with five multi-kills, two clutches, 19 kills in total and 165 ADR. SAW 10-10  BIG SAW got off to a running start on the terrorist side and with slow, methodical play they hit double digits and put BIG on the back foot. After a failed quick play on A through apartments by the Portuguese side, however, BIG got their economy in order and are looking to make this competitive in the series' dying embers. FURIA 6-1  Liquid Once again it's Yuri ""yuurih"" Santos's time to clutch as he wins the final 1v1 against Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis despite being on just a few health points to complete a quad-kill. That's his second clutch after the 1v3 in the pistol, and he sits on a 14-3 score now as the Brazilians assume control of the half. FURIA 4-1  Liquid Can't even clip these fast enough. Now Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros steps up to the plate in the third-round forcebuy to give FURIA the momentum, as they survive the back-and-forth. FURIA 1-1  Liquid We're off to the races early in this match! Keith ""NAF"" Markovic has been making SMGs sing in recent times, and this is yet another highlight from the man. SAW 5-7  BIG BIG still have a small lead heading into the switch, but SAW did well to recover from an abysmal 2-7 start with three on the trot in the closing rounds of the first half to keep it an open game. FURIA 1-0  Liquid It's Anubis to start, a map Liquid are looking to make their home it seems. SAW 1-6  BIG SAW won a wild 2vs4 retake to go up 1-0 on the CT side of Inferno, but BIG forced after their plant and have since gone on to set the pace on the attack with SAW falling behind in the early rounds. ultimate to sjokz Liquid letting him make mistakes: ""We're getting along really well, we're having a lot of fun.

I'm just trying to make as few mistakes as I can, which is impossible, but I'm trying my best."" SAW 5-13  BIG Just like that, SAW have quickly dispatched of BIG on Ancient, and so both teams have one-sidedly taken the other team's map pick. Inferno is up next to decide it all. A painful loss for FlyQuest who never really had a chance to contest for the series and especially on Ancient, where they won both pistols and still ended on just four rounds to their name. The Australians leave Cologne in last place, their third consecutive bomb-out after what looked like a resurgence at ESL Pro League late last season. The MongolZ 8-1  FlyQuest With control of B lane every round, The MongolZ have had most of the Ancient map to themselves and are running circles around FlyQuest. It's gotten to a point where the Mongolians are getting a little ahead of themselves and are just going for every individual play, but it hasn't cost them anything yet. SAW 5-2  BIG SAW are flying ahead on Ancient after losing the pistol round and winning the forcebuy. Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto won a crucial clutch on the A site with a crisp deagle headshot to keep the Portuguese side in control. SAW 7-13  BIG It wasn't really a contest. The Portuguese squad only managed to win four rounds in open play after going up 3-0 on the T side, unable to exploit the B site as they had against The MongolZ on the opening day due to an impressive defensive performance by Jon ""JDC"" de Castro. The series moves to BIG's pick of Ancient up next. It was The MongolZ' map to lose from the early stages as they put together a great defensive half, but it still got awkward towards the end when they lost to a full eco and the clutch round to Christopher ""dexter"" Nong. It didn't matter in the end because the Mongolians won a couple of forcebuys of their own on the T side to break the Australians twice over and rally to a relatively comfortable win. The MongolZ 10-8  FlyQuest The perfect sneak through a smoke and a well-placed nade help Christopher ""dexter"" Nong win a crucial 1v3 as Anubis reaches the closing stages. The MongolZ 8-6  FlyQuest The Australians had all the info but none of the anti-flash posturing to contend against this brutal Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch pop flash through the camera smoke. SAW 5-7  BIG Jon ""JDC"" de Castro posted 15 kills and 104 ADR at the end of the CT half on Anubis, which BIG won by two rounds before heading into the harder T side. The 24-year-old held down the B site, not allowing SAW to abuse the site the same way they did against The MongolZ in their opener. BIG 6-4  SAW The Portuguese team broke a six-round run from BIG on the CT side with a round they didn't look like they had any business winning, but the Germans left the retake a little too late and so just the right kill on the defusing tabseN was enough. SAW 3-4  BIG SAW got off to a dream 3-0 start on their Anubis pick, even starting on the attack, but then failed to run away early on as BIG have put up a wall on the T-sided map with guns in play winning four in a row. BIG's Ancient pick will follow with Inferno in the chamber as the decider if a tie-breaker is necessary. BIG 3-3  SAW Jon ""JDC"" de Castro's form came under fire on the desk, as he has been struggling to find the same impact in his more passive roles following the arrival of Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi. So far he has stepped up to the plate with a crucial Five-Seven double in round 4 and followed it up with a triple in the next. SAW and BIG face off on Anubis first, where the Portuguese side took down The MongolZ yesterday after an overtime affair. The elimination game between The MongolZ and FlyQuest also starts on Anubis, the Australians' pick. Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz spoke to HLTV yesterday and said this about the upcoming matchup against SAW: ""I'm really looking forward to playing against them. SAW are kind of like BIG. They're a team that isn't really on people's radars. They are underdogs most of the time and they also have the family vibes and stuff. So I'm looking forward to having a good game. I also have a good relationship with them, so I just wish them a good game. Not good luck, just a good game."" The IGL also spoke about Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi's development and how his aggressive style can complement a more controlled BIG: Day two at IEM Cologne is set to begin and we have three advancement and three elimination matches on the menu: Qualification matches Elimination matches",8-8-2024 22:15,1723148100000
ElIGE powers COL to group stage; Falcons limp on,https://www.hltv.org/news/39562/elige-powers-col-to-group-stage-falcons-limp-on,"The American team floundered to victory in a messy end to the series on Dust2. Complexity are through to the group stage of IEM Cologne after scoring a 2-0 victory over Eternal Fire in the upper bracket, recovering from a poor start on Vertigo to steal the map before edging past the Turkish side in a messy — but entertaining — double overtime affair on Dust2. Simultaneously, Falcons saw to the elimination of ALTERNATE aTTaX in the lower bracket, but failed to show a good account of themselves in an error-prone series and still have a match against BIG in the cards if they want to secure a spot in the group stage. Eternal Fire had cast Falcons down to the lower bracket on the first day of play after a radiant performance by Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş, who shone in a 2-1 series that included a dominant showing on Vertigo and a narrow win on Dust2. Likely spurred on by their one-sided victory against Falcons, the Turkish team opted for a Vertigo pick against Complexity too, and made good on that choice in the first half as Ali ""Wicadia"" Haydar Yalçın and XANTARES' entries tore apart Complexity's defenses. The latter cooled off in the second half, however, and Complexity completely flipped the script as they won 10 rounds in a row off the back of a 1vs3 pistol clutch and superlative T-side showing from Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski to steal away the map. Eternal Fire began Dust2 in control but failed to hold on after a 1vs2 ace clutch by Michael ""Grim"" Wince gave Complexity the momentum, allowing the American team to tie the game at 6-6 at the break before they romped to an 11-6 lead after the break. Messy Counter-Strike unfolded, though, with Özgür ""woxic"" Eker capitalizing on mistakes from Complexity while Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli's frustrations continued to build. Eternal Fire managed to force overtime off the back of a pivotal 1vs2 clutch by Engin ""MAJ3R"" Küpeli, but unconvincing rounds from both sides kept the battle going into a second set of rounds. Complexity took the early lead there, but nearly gave away the goose after squandering a 4vs2 and almost losing a 5vs3, only for Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou to bail his side out with a clutch that led to victory. Falcons were entirely unconvincing in their series as they failed to stamp authority over ALTERNATE aTTaX and played some incredibly sloppy Counter-Strike despite securing a 2-0 win. The German team took an early lead on Anubis off the back of a 1vs3 clutch from Marcel ""hyped"" Köhn, with Falcons floundering for a response before eventually breaking through with a force-buy. A resurgence on the T side from Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer and company saw them win seven of the first eight rounds to hit map point, but even then they barely closed out the game in regulation in an unconvincing show of force. Sloppy play from both sides continued on Mirage, although Falcons looked more comfortable as they jumped out to a strong lead at the break. Errors and woeful play for a team of their caliber persisted, however, and despite them closing the map 13-9, they will be hard-pressed to battle past other teams if this is the level they put up for the rest of the event.",8-8-2024 22:32,1723149120000
Jackinho steps back from Metizport,https://www.hltv.org/news/39561/jackinho-steps-back-from-metizport,"The Swedish AWPing IGL is taking a break to focus on his mental health. Jack ""Jackinho"" Ström Mattsson has decided to take a step back from Counter-Strike to focus on his mental health, leaving Metizport without a full starting lineup. Metizport's statement suggested Jackinho would return to the team at some point, saying ""he has chosen to... take a break to rejuvenate and recharge."" 25-year-old Jackinho has been with Metizport since September 2023, helping the organization hit their peak ranking of No. 29 in the world during his tenure. The team briefly featured amongst tier-one sides earlier this year, taking down Falcons and Monte at the online BLAST Spring Showdown, but several pieces of that roster have since moved on, namely Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson and Tim ""susp"" Ångström, who transferred to GamerLegion and Wildcard respectively. Jackinho has served as both an AWPer and IGL during his stint with Metizport without setting the world alight statistically, averaging a 1.01 since joining the team.

"Twistzz on ultimate: ""The sky is the limit for him""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39560/twistzz-on-ultimate-the-sky-is-the-limit-for-him,"The Canadian IGL heaped praise on his teammate after yet another win. Liquid have locked up a spot in the group stage of IEM Cologne 2024 after a hard-fought 2-1 victory over FURIA. It's the fifth win in a row for Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's troops, who are carrying on the momentum from their undefeated BLAST Fall Groups run. Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak played a key role in Liquid's victory with a stellar performance on Nuke (1.32 rating) and a 1v2 clutch on Mirage late in the game. He ended the Play-In as Liquid's highest-rated player (1.21) and earned praise from Twistzz. ""Considering he can rifle and AWP, the sky's the limit for him,"" the Canadian told HLTV after the match. The competition will get much tougher from now on for Liquid, but Twistzz is not fazed and said that his team will take it match by match.""Until, you know, maybe you'll see us in the arena."" Twistzz, this was your fifth match with this roster and your fifth victory. The win streak continues. Things are looking pretty good, don't you think? Yeah, of course, I'm very proud of my players. Obviously, we put in as much work as we could. Barely like, I don't know, three days after my wedding, we were instantly in the server. I finished the whole playbook before that, and then from there on out, we just used the playbook and improved on things throughout the weeks leading up to the events. I knew what we were building was going to be strong, but to say it has surpassed my expectations… I mean, to be honest, I didn't make expectations. But I'm just very happy with the performances that we're putting in and the individuals are… You just feel, like, passion in the room. Can you walk me through the series? Because that first map was a little bit rough, but it seemed that you improved as the series went on. Yeah, I'm not going to lie, I was a bit caught off-guard about Anubis being let through by them because our pick was going to be Ancient. I could say they had a good game plan on it. They played differently compared to the other teams we've faced on Anubis. From there on out I was a bit excited to finally get to play some T side Nuke, had a good CT side comeback as well, and then was also excited to play Mirage, after our defeat to NAVI on it. Yeah, only good things to say. You've had some very close games with this roster, and it seems that every time you manage to pull through in the end. I guess that shows the team's resilience at the moment. Yeah. I mean, that's the whole mental part of the game, right? I've told these guys multiple times, like, 'It's okay to make mistakes. I want us to just play the game. Play the way you want to play.' And as long as they're listening to me and they still make their own moves and have initiative, I'm happy. That's really all I tell them before games. Win or lose, I just want to play good CS together and enjoy the game. And so far, it's been like this every series. Some might say this is just a honeymoon period, but I think one of the most interesting aspects about the team is that you've picked up victories on pretty much every map in the pool. I guess that speaks to the work that everyone has been putting in. Yeah, of course. That was, like, my whole intention coming out of the player break, to have a deep map pool to kick off the first two events of the year. Some could say that we're still missing things, at least I feel that way, and we're having to do our best now without having time to practice and continue adding things on the fly. But yeah, I'm happy to display a strong map pool to start off. I think it's fun, every time we're moving to a new T side, like on a map, I'm just like: 'Finally I get to call on a new map.' ultimate had a very impactful series. He had that clutch now on Mirage towards the end, and overall he's been one of your best-performing players in this tournament. You were the one who picked him, you said that he passed your eye test. You must be pretty happy about the decision you made, right? laughs I mean, I was already happy the first day I talked to him. Before, you know, saying to Liquid that this was the guy. My first interview with him, I was just super, super happy. It gave me the vibes that I was looking for. From all the demo watching and everything, I knew the player I was getting, and I'm just happy that he has found a lot of comfort with us and enjoys us as people. And how far do you think that he can go? Because he seems to be very good, not just with the AWP, but also with rifles. He's had some clutches with rifles in this tournament. Oh yeah. I mean, considering he can rifle and AWP, the sky's the limit for him. I think it's more about making sure that in my system and what I'm creating, it's always fresh and something new for him and that he understands the control and power that he has in the team. I think he can only evolve and go from here, and it's also our job to make sure that he stays on this track and that we also help him improve. You're now going to the group stage, where competition will be much tougher. You said you had no expectations heading into this tournament, but considering how much you've progressed since the team was put together, how far do you expect to go? Everything's a new goal, right? Honestly, it's just one map at a time, one match at a time, until we make it wherever, whenever. For BLAST, there were no expectations. Even when we beat NAVI, there was no pressure to win the second match really, I just wanted us to play well. It's the same thing here. I just want us to play good CS and we're taking it game by game, and if we lose, we're going to improve and work on things. If we win, we're still going to work and improve on things, but keep the flow of energy as a team. But yeah, not trying to set insane expectations for this event. Game by game, until, you know, maybe you'll see us in the arena.",8-8-2024 23:00,1723150800000
Latest CS2 update causes further boosting issues*,https://www.hltv.org/news/39563/latest-cs2-update-causes-further-boosting-issues,"In an effort to solve difficulties with players boosting on top of one another, Valve have inadvertently made the issue worse. Update: In a small follow-up patch nearly three hours after the original update, Valve has resolved the newly-introduced boost bug. Valve have released a new CS2 update, with the patch focusing primarily on a number of minor tweaks. By far the most notable change brought about in this update is the effort Valve has made towards resolving issues associated with player boosts. In an effort to solve previous issues associated with boosting by ""restricting upward movement of a player when a teammate is boosted on their head,"" this tweak has instead introduced a game-breaking bug that allows for the bottom player in a boost to remain floating in the air. The full list of changes in this update are as follows: GAMEPLAY- In Casual game mode players will earn an additional XP score point for every round in which they dealt damage to enemies.- Added a server setting ""sv_vote_to_changelevel_rndmin"" to control rounds/time during which voting for a level change is allowed.- Official game servers in Casual game mode now allow voting for a level change only at the end of the match or during the first round of the match.- Official game servers in Deathmatch and Arms Race game modes now allow voting for a level change only at the end of the match or during the first minute of the match.- Restricted upward movement of a player when a teammate is boosted on their head.- Dead players are no longer allowed to pick up ground weapons.- Buy menu will automatically close if the switch team menu opens.- Rescuing a hostage now increments objectives counter in match stats. UI- Improved legibility of damage given and taken in post-round damage report.- Made spec target highlighting more pronounced.- Player names are now visible on mini scoreboard whenever the mini scoreboard is expanded.

Perfect World announce RMR and qualifier invites,https://www.hltv.org/news/39564/perfect-world-announce-rmr-and-qualifier-invites,"Over a hundred teams received invites either directly to each Regional Major Ranking event or its closed qualifiers. Update August 10: Akimbo reassigned to NA closed qualifier Akimbo, a Mongolian-majority team residing in North America, have been reassigned from East Asia, filling the last spot in the NA closed qualifier that was previously empty due to not enough teams being ranked. Perfect World have confirmed the list of invited teams to the Regional Major Ranking events in Europe, Americas and Asia and their respective closed qualifiers ahead of the Perfect World Shanghai Major. These are based on the Valve Regional Standings from August 6, which can be found here, and are still pending confirmation from the teams themselves, Perfect World have clarified to HLTV. Half of the participating teams in Europe (16) and the Americas (8) received direct invites to the RMRs, while in Asia three slots were filled by direct invites. The remaining 16, eight and five teams, respectively, will come from various closed qualifiers, which will kick off from August 21. In several cases teams were cut from the list, due to that team participating in a different region (Liquid, who could apply for either Europe or the Americas, for example) or due to Valve's ruling against one organization fielding multiple teams across the various qualifiers. In Europe and the Americas, direct invites based on the standings served as the only route to participation in the Major qualifying system after open qualifiers were removed in the two regions earlier this year. There is however one empty slot in the NA closed qualifier at the moment because not enough teams were ranked in the region. In Asia, open qualifiers remained in each of the five sub-regions to determine four of the eight participating teams in each. However, these are likely to fill more spots than originally intended, as the Middle East, China and Rest of Asia qualifiers didn't feature enough teams on the ranking to receive four invites. It is worth noting that an outdated Cloud9 roster featuring the previous core is listed as part of the invites to the European closed qualifier, as the new roster had not yet played the required 10 matches to be ranked. It is possible that the Russian side will submit four of their current players plus Ilya ""Perfecto"" Zalutskiy to ensure a core of the invited roster remains intact, and then substitute him with the last player from the existing roster ahead of the start of the closed qualifier. The Regional Major Ranking events will all take place in Shanghai, China from November 11-24, ending less than a week before the Shanghai Major kicks off on November 30 with the opening stage. The entire online portion of the qualifying stage will run between August 21-30 depending on the region and stage.

9z defeat regional rivals MIBR to qualify for IEM Cologne group stage,https://www.hltv.org/news/39566/9z-defeat-regional-rivals-mibr-to-qualify-for-iem-cologne-group-stage,"On the B stream, paiN earned their sixth win in a row against Imperial to keep their Cologne hopes alive. 9z followed up their opening day victory against 3DMAX with a 2-0 over regional rivals MIBR to secure a spot at the IEM Cologne group stage, sending their Brazilian foes down to the lower bracket decider. In the other South American matchup, paiN took down Imperial for the sixth time in a row to earn a lower bracket matchup against MIBR, recovering from a narrow loss to Liquid on the opening day. 9z found it in them to recover on the T side of Ancient, MIBR's pick, when it looked like the Brazilians were going to cruise to victory on their map pick. After forcing overtime in an incredibly tight 3vs3 afterplant on B, Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez and his men went on to win it out 16-13 to get within a map of their goal. Nuke was no contest. MIBR looked like they were going to put up a fight with a clever play in Yard, throwing grenades into the smoke wall and getting two entry kills, but from there on out 9z called circles around the Brazilians, going on a tear. Raphael ""exit"" Lacerda almost got a 1vs5 against his overconfident opponents late in the first half,  but a smart play by Franco ""dgt"" Garcia denied him the pleasure as 9z smashed their way to a 10-2 at the switch and a 13-2 victory to close out the series 2-0. paiN and Imperial's series was a back and forth affair, with the first two maps both coming down to relatively fine margins. Dust2 was thrown away by paiN after they had worked hard to get themselves back into a hard-fought map, rotating away from a Long attack with no map control and no time, losing to the round to a bad buy. This cost them an 0-1 deficit in the series. Vertigo seemed to be going comfortably in paiN's favour, but some excellent work from Santino ""try"" Rigal and Lucas ""decenty"" Bacelar granted Imperial strong finishes to both halves. Ultimately paiN had enough in the tank to hold on, largely due to a powerful performance by Lucas ""nqz"" Soares. paiN's superiority told on Inferno, as they were the better team on both sides of the map. paiN dealt with Imperial's simplistic T side comfortably for an 8-4 lead at halftime, won their offensive pistol, and duly closed out the map to keep their Cologne dreams alive.",9-8-2024 17:02,1723215720000

So far, it has been smooth sailing for the South American team, who came through the Play-In without dropping a map. Currently ranked 13th in the world, 9z are looking to build on last season's success. They surpassed everyone's expectations when they reached the semi-finals at IEM Dallas and then won the FiReLEAGUE 2024 Global Finals title after beating KOI and fnatic in the playoffs. After the match against MIBR, Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez sat down with HLTV to discuss the team's Play-In results, the preparation for Cologne, and what life in Madrid has been like. max, this was your second 2-0 victory and you're through to the group stage. Are you pleased with the team's performances? Yes, I'm very pleased with the team, with the resilience that we showed today on Ancient, which wasn't an easy game. We were able to close it out and keep up a good attitude. We knew Ancient would be tough because it's a good map of theirs. We knew what we had to do, and I think we executed it well. That's why we turned it around and then it was a snowball that took it to Nuke. I was reading the article that we did on the team, and dgt said that one of the reasons you did so well at the end of last season was that you didn't feel pressure. Do you think that semi-final run in Dallas and the FiReLEAGUE trophy have brought more pressure to the team? I think it's the opposite, actually. I think the FiReLEAGUE trophy has really helped us because we were missing a title, so it was like, 'Ufff, we've done it.' Now it's about continuing to do what we've been doing because we're on the right path. Do you think other teams respect 9z more after those two events? That might be the case, but, again, we've been winning and doing a good job for years. I think we're getting to where we want to be. What about internally? Do you believe more in yourselves since Dallas? Yes, that tournament in Dallas has really helped with our confidence. We showed in a tier-one tournament that we can beat any team in the world. It was a huge confidence boost for us. You only played two online matches in Europe before coming here. Were you focused on preparing for Cologne? Exactly. We were coming back from holiday, so we wanted to focus on practicing really hard for the big tournament we had ahead. What has it been like for the team to adapt to life in Madrid? What are the key differences between practice in Europe and South America? Madrid has been really nice, the place where we are staying is very good, we are very comfortable. It's not easy to be away from your family, your girlfriend, and your loved ones, but everyone has to follow their dreams, and our dream was here. To be a tier-one team, we needed to make this leap and we've done it. We are very happy. There are a lot of good teams in Brazil, like Imperial, paiN and MIBR, but in Europe there's more variety. Many tier-two teams play differently, and that really helps because you come across different styles. Now that you're in the group stage, what are your goals? Do you think it's possible to get to the playoffs again? Ah, we're always thinking step by step. At first, we were only thinking about winning the first match, then we started thinking about MIBR. Now, we're going to think about the next match, which will be tomorrow. It's going to be a tough game because it will be against a good team, but we're going for the win.",9-8-2024 17:29,1723217340000
"FURIA qualify for Cologne groups, HEROIC out",https://www.hltv.org/news/39568/furia-qualify-for-cologne-groups-heroic-out,"The Brazilians squeezed through the first stage after a nail-biting three-mapper against HEROIC. FURIA are the next team through to the IEM Cologne group stage after a hard-earned victory over HEROIC in the lower bracket of the play-in. Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski's team has been eliminated from the tournament after a difficult campaign, in which they were first forced to play with Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk and got off with a loss to MIBR. The Russian AWPer resolved his visa issues to fly in in time to help the team get past 3DMAX, but the team went on to miss out on the groups by just two rounds in the FURIA affair. The newest addition to the Brazilian side, Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros, put in crucial performances in his team's narrow win. On Mirage, the former Liquid anchor topped the board with a 1.41-rated performance as FURIA just barely squeezed by their opponents in regulation, and combined with Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato in a final-round 2v5 clutch that pushed his team over the line. Clip: skullz & KSCERATO turn a 2v5 to win Mirage A curious choice to pick Anubis, which was FURIA's permaban not too long ago, ended up backfiring on the Brazilians. ""Anubis sucks, I don't know why we play this map (laughs),"" Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo joked after the match. ""You gotta do what you gotta do.

SunPayus stars as Falcons make Cologne groups,https://www.hltv.org/news/39569/sunpayus-stars-as-falcons-make-cologne-groups,"Hometown heroes BIG have been eliminated from IEM Cologne. Falcons have defeated BIG in the IEM Cologne Play-In in a three-map series (Dust2 13-7, Mirage 10-13, Anubis 13-10) to qualify for the group stage. The win marks a much-needed boost for the Falcons side, which found success hard to come by recently, but a subdued post-match reaction shows that they haven't reached their expectations yet. ""We played some decent CS and felt comfortable, but the scoreline said something else,"" said Emil ""Magisk"" Reif in a post-match interview before touching on Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García's stand-out performance. ""You need some time to get some success and get out of a tough period. It's nice to see he fought the demons and came back so strongly."" Conversely, Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz was distraught after such a close loss. ""Small details decided the game, and our pick of Dust2 was terribly executed. It's heartbreaking right now, but there are some positives too."" The series began on BIG's pick of Dust2, but the German side got off to a nightmare start on the map and found itself 2-10 down after the first half. Magisk and Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković both put up over 120 ADR on the defense, and despite BIG's cosmetic comeback in the second half, Falcons' win was never in doubt.

Anubis began with SunPayus taking over the CT side with 17 kills and a 2.09 rating, with Falcons' pistol-round victory giving them a seemingly insurmountable 11-4 lead. BIG gave it a good go and brought it back to 10-12 after SunPayus cooled off somewhat, but a rag-tag buy broke through the A-site defense and meant Falcons secured a 13-10 victory.

Is Cologne make or break for FaZe?,https://www.hltv.org/news/39506/is-cologne-make-or-break-for-faze,"What was once one of the most competitive lineups of 2024 has now been forced to re-evaluate everything before IEM Cologne. ""Sooner or later we had to have that really bad loss like this to be able to keep grinding and keep improving. Eventually, it would have happened, and rather it would happen here than in Cologne."" - Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen This is what FaZe's decorated captain had to say following his team's disappointing exit from IEM Dallas, a quarter-final loss to a G2 lineup fielding a stand-in. The Dane held his head high despite the unexpected result and recognized that FaZe had a good season overall. They won a title at IEM Chengdu and recorded an impressive streak of finals, which makes them strong contenders for the year’s most consistent team. After IEM Dallas, karrigan made clear that FaZe had a game plan. Discussing the team's response after their early exit, the captain described a two-hour-long team talk, during which issues like positions, burnout, and how to improve into the next season were covered. Although it seemed like FaZe were beginning to cool off from their red-hot start to CS2, karrigan was doing his best to reassure people that he and his teammates were keen on returning to winning ways in short order. ""We have to lower our expectations. We are not performing as we need to, losing in different ways. Coming into Cologne, it's going to be very rough. We need to wake up and look ourselves in the mirror."" - Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen Fast forward two months after the conclusion of FaZe's IEM Dallas campaign, and the environment is now drastically different with IEM Cologne around the corner. The international side have now followed up their impressive finals streak with a new streak: four consecutive quarter-final exits, broken only by a 9-12th finish at the BLAST Fall Groups. After the 0-2 loss to Ninjas in Pyjamas that sent them packing from the Fall Groups, karrigan painted a far more dreary picture of the team's hopes in Cologne. While the captain seemed to have previously been hopeful about fixing FaZe's problems ahead of the flagship event in Germany, karrigan was now blunt in stating that expectations should be low for the team, and that Cologne would be a tough event. That FaZe are preemptively dismissing their performance at one of the biggest events of the year in this manner speaks volumes about their current state — an impressive decline considering that they had been consistently reaching finals mere months ago. Confidence issues have been a major talking point for karrigan, who says that they are causing a lack of ""killer instinct"" which has left FaZe scrambling in tight situations. The in-game leader's dismal statement ahead of Cologne represents the pinnacle of this confidence problem, with the team seemingly having spiraled to the point that missing out on the Lanxess is simply an acceptable write-off in the long-term pursuit of fixing their current issues. ""We will make this work, and I take a big responsibility in us failing. If there is anyone to blame, it’s me and not others. We will bounce back, and if not, it’s on me."" -Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen In addition to the aforementioned issue of confidence that has been a focal point in interviews with karrigan, the Dane has also been open about his own poor performances in recent times, while also attempting to take on the brunt of the criticism directed towards FaZe's players. Despite karrigan's insistence that he receive the blame for his side's shortcomings, teammate Robin ""ropz"" Kool has been placed in the crosshairs amidst a mixed bag of performances that include 0.95 and 0.99 ratings in the team's last two outings before IEM Cologne. karrigan quickly came to the defense of his long-time teammate, acknowledging issues of confidence while simultaneously assuring that the whole team was doing their best to alleviate these issues and support ropz during this slump. With that in mind, karrigan did acquiesce that, at the end of the day, it was ultimately the Estonian who had to be the one to believe in himself. To point fingers at just ropz places an unfair burden on him. His role as a more passive component of the team fundamentally requires the more aggressive players like karrigan and Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard to provide opportunities for him to activate. This is not to say that ropz should be entirely absolved from his poor showings, but rather that those performances should be considered within a wider context that suggests more issues at hand than just poor form from one player. ""Every player in every single sport has had slumps. It depends on how you come out on the other side. The most important thing is to keep doing what you do and keep believing in what you're doing."" - Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen Having grappled with FaZe's mindset ahead of Cologne, their struggle to maintain confidence, and the rough showings from individual players, the question now becomes: What does IEM Cologne mean for FaZe at this point? As of now, the most reasonable conclusion is that the international side will still be in the process of reworking and reevaluating their fundamentals, acknowledging that they are simply not in any shape to contend for the title. Aside from karrigan's earlier comments regarding his expectations for the tournament being ""very rough,"" this long-term thinking is further supported by a comment the skipper made ahead of the Fall Groups when he noted that the team's priority at the moment was ""trying to create a better foundation when we're playing our B-game,"" in order to give the team a fighting chance on off days. While this is certainly a pragmatic approach, how much does it really differ from the other internal solutions that the team has surely attempted to implement over the course of the last two months? Furthermore, simply acknowledging that the trophy is likely out of reach for FaZe this time around may not be enough to buffer the hit in confidence the team would likely endure after another early exit from a tournament, piling on more problems in that department. Some may suggest that a roster move may be In the cards for FaZe considering their downward trend. The recent success of the newly-revamped G2 lineup may serve as a tantalizing prospect to those advocating for changes, but it is unlikely that FaZe will be swayed in that direction for now. Time is of the essence for FaZe, as only four events separate them from the beginning of their PGL Shanghai Major campaign. Making a change to their lineup after IEM Cologne would give the international side just three chances to stick the landing, a daunting task that may leave them worse off than where they started. Likewise, chemistry issues will also be a concern; a lineup change to a team as tight-knit as FaZe may end up doing more harm than good. This is not to say that FaZe should not be concerned about the clock if they continue with their current five. While other top contenders like Spirit, Natus Vincere, and MOUZ are already warming up into the season, FaZe have been forced back to the drawing board after just one month back in action. If IEM Cologne proves to be a bust, karrigan and his men will have just three chances to make up for their dreadful start to the second half of the year. At a minimum, FaZe will need to do their best to extract at least some value out of Cologne, even if they endure an early exit. To enter Cologne with a defeatist mindset and come out the other side with no progress towards improving represents the worst possible outcome, one that they should desperately avoid lest the rest of the year start to slip from their grasp.",9-8-2024 20:46,1723229160000
The MongolZ move on in Cologne after overtime decider against Eternal Fire,https://www.hltv.org/news/39571/the-mongolz-move-on-in-cologne-after-overtime-decider-against-eternal-fire,"MAJ3R took responsibility for a lackluster Terrorist side on Nuke as Eternal Fire suffered another early exit. The MongolZ became the penultimate team to advance to the IEM Cologne group stage following a 2-1 win over Eternal Fire in the lower bracket of the play-in stage. The Mongolian side barely eked out the deciding victory after coming back from a beatdown on the opening map, Anubis. Their Mirage pick worked out swimmingly as they took advantage of a rusty Eternal Fire, as well as an off performance from Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş, and made a comeback from down 4-9 on the deciding Nuke. The 29-year-old Turkish star looked determined to set the record straight heading into Nuke and all but single-handedly secured his team a dominant CT half, but his carry performance was not enough in the end. Clip: XANTARES dominates MongolZ in yard A couple of wins with just pistols towards the end of the half gave The MongolZ a saving grace, and they followed it up with a superb CT side as Eternal Fire struggled to make their upper hits work. Aggression from Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren in yard in a couple of crucial rounds gave his team an early warning to beat the Turks' executes back. In a switch of the approach up against match point, XANTARES then went searching in yard to find two openings and followed it up with a triple, sending the game to overtime. Once there, though, Engin ""MAJ3R"" Küpeli decided to return to the upper hits, which once again failed to hit the mark, and The MongolZ went on to close the match on the T side. After the game, MAJ3R took responsibility for the loss on the analyst desk. ""I think it's on me, T side Nuke I didn't find a lot of solutions, they started with double AWPs and I focused my game plan on inner because of that, but it didn't work really well. I apologize to my teammates and all the fans."" With the disappointment, Eternal Fire continue a run of lackluster form following their run to the playoffs at PGL Major Copenhagen. Since then, their best LAN result was a top-four finish at Skyesports Championship, where Eternal Fire were also eliminated by the Mongolian squad.",9-8-2024 23:12,1723237920000
paiN beat MIBR to progress through the play-in,https://www.hltv.org/news/39572/pain-beat-mibr-to-progress-through-the-play-in,"The Brazilians secured the final group stage spot on offer. paiN defeated MIBR in the domestic derby in three maps (Mirage 13-10, Anubis 4-13, Vertigo 13-3) to secure the final IEM Cologne group stage spot. The matchup has been a frequent one back in Brazil, as the teams played 18 maps in 2024 before their matchup at IEM Cologne, and Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt admitted that played a part on the decider. ""The last time we played against them MIBR on Vertigo, it was 13-0, so I said if we win the knife, we win the game,"" the Brazilian shared with a smile on his face. The series began with a brawly affair on Mirage, where a 1v2 on each side of the server meant the teams were neck and neck in the dying stages of the map. paiN needed biguzera to find a fantastic timing with a Window flank to find an entry into the B site, which helped them secure a 13-10 win.

Raphael ""exit"" Lacerda, Felipe ""insani"" Yuji, and Rafael ""saffee"" Costa all had standout moments as paiN simply couldn't get going, meaning a Vertigo decider was needed. The third map was another one-sided affair, this time in paiN's favor.

The Brazilians had to survive back-to-back elimination matches against Imperial and MIBR, coming back from a map down in both series. There's little time for rest now, with the group stage about to kick off, paiN have been placed in Group A, the tougher of the two groups, which also includes three red-hot favorites for the title in Natus Vincere, G2 and Spirit. The first round will put the Brazilians on a collision course with Natus Vincere in a rematch of the PGL Major Copenhagen's 2-2 round of the Elimination Stage. The European team ran out 2-0 winners  before going on to win the trophy. ""We have the best of expectations,"" Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt told HLTV.

""His adaptation is going very well, he is a hard-working guy,"" biguzera said. ""He really wants to be here, he really wants to get to the next stage and win the event.

FaZe send Liquid to lower bracket in Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39577/faze-send-liquid-to-lower-bracket-in-cologne,"IEM Cologne's group stage begins with FaZe ending Liquid's brief win streak after two closely fought maps. In a highlight match of the opening round of IEM Cologne's group stage, FaZe took down Liquid 2-0 to move on in the upper bracket of Group B and send Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and company to the elimination zone. With the victory, FaZe ended Liquid's win streak with the new lineup featuring Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak and Justin ""jks"" Savage at five matches in a row following their successful run at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups and Cologne's play-in stage. Though they might have lost their ""killer instinct"" in recent times, the Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen-led side showed they can still shine under pressure, as they edged out Liquid on two close maps. On Mirage, they punished a shallow-looking Liquid gameplan at the start, as Twistzz's quick approaches early on the T side failed to find the mark. But with the Canadian switching focus to Mid takes and finding advantages there time and time again, the first map proved more difficult for FaZe than the opening five rounds suggested. Liquid grabbed a lead late once on the CT side with Twistzz defending the A bombsite with a triple, but the tide turned when FaZe found crucial timings to hit the same site while Liquid repeatedly opted for heavy mid control. As the second half progressed the Canadian rifler's lacking combination with a struggling jks on the A bombsite proved to be Liquid's undoing, as FaZe repeatedly punished them there on the way to a 13-11 victory despite ultimate's best efforts to turn it back around. Clip: ultimate finds four up against map point The Pole continued to showcase his stellar form on Nuke, but his efforts were once again in vain with FaZe, powered by an improved Robin ""ropz"" Kool, kicking into gear when the pressure mounted. After a wash of a first half, Liquid took a lead at the beginning of second off of a jks quad-kill and clutch in the pistol, but they then couldn't make their slow approaches in yard work. FaZe's 4v5 gamble stack in round 17 was perhaps telling of what karrigan spoke about in a pre-match interview, saying Liquid might not be ready for a change in FaZe's playstyle, and served as the turning point late in the map. From there, karrigan's team closed it after winning several close situations, denying jks and ultimate 1v3 clutch attempts on the way to a 13-10 win.

"Magisk: ""It's definitely going to be a confidence boost for SunPayus""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39570/magisk-its-definitely-going-to-be-a-confidence-boost-for-sunpayus,"""It makes me happy to see that he stepped up in the most important moment,"" added the Dane. Falcons have had a rough 2024 so far, with many of their players not finding form in CS2. Confidence has been at an all-time low as their members have looked dejected on player cams time after time, but Emil ""Magisk"" Reif hopes their recent victory will be a boost in self-belief. The squad traversed the IEM Cologne Play-In with wins over ALTERNATE aTTaX and BIG to make it to the group stage, with Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García looking sharp against Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz and company. After their qualification, Magisk spoke to HLTV about their start to the season, SunPayus's performance, and his expectations for the rest of the event. Magisk, a hard-fought 2-1 victory to send you to the group stage. Maden had said before the series that he wanted this to be a match where you could get your confidence back. Do you think, looking back, that it gave you confidence? I think both yes and no.  I think we would have closed it out easily 2-0 if we hadn't lost some stupid rounds on Mirage, the full eco and also the 4-on-3 where we had a good situation and knew exactly where they were. I would have loved to have won 2-0, but at the end of the day, we got the win. Obviously, it was a bit stronger opponent today, so that helps with the confidence, also to win a few games in a row, which is a good thing, because we have been struggling to get the Ws at the end. It feels nice to finally be able to close out games, also the close ones. Obviously, it's more confidence than going out. It was a tough game, but I think we also finally managed to have the nerves on our side. SunPayus had a fantastic series, probably one of the best he has had since he joined the team. At least for him, it was probably a confidence boost, don't you think? I think it was definitely most needed, to have this breakout series and multiple good maps in a row. Of course, it makes me happy to see that he stepped up in the most important moment and also had some really huge rounds. So yeah, it's definitely going to be a good confidence boost for him. He's obviously been having it a little bit rough the last few games, so it's nice to see that he can break out of that barrier and kind of move on and focus on the next game in front of him. Can you walk me through the series? The first map was kind of easy for you. Then, on Mirage, the intensity died down a little bit, and then on the third map, you almost had a huge lead slip. On Dust2 we just had the momentum and we managed to close it out before it got close. So that was obviously a good feeling.  Mirage, it also felt like we had it in our hands, but, as I mentioned, we lost the full eco and also the 4 vs 3, which shouldn't happen. So I think that if we had managed to close out those two rounds we would have won the map pretty comfortably. But at the end of the day, that's Counter-Strike. You win some of those and you lose some of those.  We obviously need to work on closing out those rounds if we want to win the maps. On Anubis, they only won one buy round on the whole T side, so when we had such a big lead we maybe went a bit away from what we know and what we usually do good, kind of forgetting the way we flash for each other, where we take certain areas and stuff like that. So we became a little bit too sloppy and that cost us a lot because we got kind of broke, economy-wise. So the game got close. We managed to close it out with a force buy. Again, that's Counter-Strike sometimes. They won those on Mirage and we won those on Anubis. Yesterday, it felt like after you beat ALTERNATE aTTaX the vibes were still not very good. Today, there were certain moments when players appeared to be shutting down a little bit, especially on Mirage and now towards the end on Anubis. What can you say about the team atmosphere this past couple of months? Obviously, we would love to have better results. I think it's quite obvious that with the players we have on the team, it would be nice to have better results. But at the end of the day, we're having a lot of talks and are kind of trying to set the expectations right. Right now, we probably just have to accept that we need to be patient, work long-term, try to improve from game to game and make sure that we make fewer mistakes every tournament and every game we play. It's tough when you keep losing and you don't have the results you want to have. I think our mindset has changed a little bit, in the sense that we need to work long-term and make sure we try and improve as much as possible. Being here in Cologne, we want to do our very best and we want to go as far as possible. I also know that if we play at our highest level, we can beat a lot of the top teams, but it does require that we step up individually and play well as a team. And probably our biggest problem right now is the inconsistency in the individuals but also as a team sometimes. That's definitely something we are trying to improve, make sure that we get better at it and get to know each other. What people like and don't like and kind of find our own way. I was reading an interview with zonic and he said that It sees a different team in practice. Why do you think that the team hasn't been able to carry what you do in practice into official matches and tournaments? I think it comes down to the fact that we have had so many tough losses. Very close losses that could have gone our way. And when you keep losing those games, you become in some way more scared to make mistakes and be the reason that you lose those rounds and be the difference between winning and losing. I think it comes down to confidence. There's also, as I mentioned, the inconsistency, but that kind of goes hand in hand with confidence. If people have confidence, they will also take the right duels and go for what they usually do in practice where there is not the same pressure. So yeah, I think it just comes down to confidence, and sometimes you have to break that cycle with having some success, and that's also why it's nice to finally be on the winning side and make that step further into the tournament. So we'll see what happens. You're now through to the group stage where you'll join the big dogs, let's put it that way. What are your expectations for this next stage? What would you be satisfied with? At the end of the day, Counter-Strike is Counter-Strike. I feel that almost all the teams within the top 20 can beat each other on a good day. So we're going to go in with everything we have. We don't have much expectation from the outside, we don't really have any pressure on our shoulders. We should just go in, play with confidence and play to win. Take the duels we like and make moves on the map whenever we feel like it. That's obviously what we want to do. Doing it is a different story, but I think we should just enjoy the fact that no one has the biggest expectations for us, and I even think that people might underestimate us. But at the end of the day, if we don't play good Counter-Strike, if we don't play well as a team or individually, we will not be able to beat teams. So we will definitely need to be more consistent in this stage if we want to make it further. So you think you can take advantage of the surprise factor? I mean, people knew us as players obviously. I think people might underestimate the team as a whole. But of course, if we don't play well individually, it's going to be very tough, because when you are competing against the best teams in the world, you need to have good individual performances. Right now, our problem is that it's mostly one guy who is having a good performance and the other four are kind of lacking. I think we need to hit a level where we have two to three guys who are playing well individually. If you want to beat the best of the best, you need everyone to be performing at the highest level. Otherwise, it's going to be very difficult.",10-8-2024 00:12,1723241520000

Liquid 7-2  paiN We have a mirror of how Anubis kicked off with Liquid going down 0-2 before finding the rhythm on the T side, winning seven rounds straight for an immense lead.

Liquid 16-13  paiN A headscratcher of a map after Liquid almost entirely capitulated in the second half, but they got it over the line in the end. A clutch from Justin ""jks"" Savage and aggressive rifling from Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis were key in that effort, and Liquid head into their Inferno pick with the advantage. Liquid 15-12  paiN A Counter-Strike tale as old as time: The team that couldn't win rounds in regulation to close out the game stomps the same side in overtime, and now Liquid have three chances to close. Liquid 12-12  paiN Few could have seen this coming after just how dominant Liquid looked in the first half, yet here we are giving Liquid the nod for forcing overtime rather than the other way around. That T side was an absolute masterclass by paiN and João ""snow"" Vinicius's is showing no fear, but they might be left kicking themselves after losing two 5vs4s in a row to allow Liquid to force an extra set of rounds. Liquid 10-10  paiN In Chad ""SPUNJ"" Burchill's words, ""Now this game is starting to heat up."" Liquid have gotten multiple man advantages, but have wasted almost every opportunity to convert and are struggling immensely to close against some fantastic late rounds by paiN and stellar entries from João ""snow"" Vinicius. Liquid's only CT round came courtesy of a 3vs5 recovery from Justin ""jks"" Savage and Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken, but this game has been flipped on its head now as paiN close in on the lead. Liquid 9-6  paiN Liquid 9-3  paiN The only pain on the server right now is the emotional one felt by Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt's side after they went from a 2-0 lead to six rounds down. Liquid ran all over paiN's defenses in the first half with everyone other than Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken fragging heavily, with Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak continuing to show no fear or signs of pressure and Justin ""jks"" Savage looking far more comfortable back on the server. FURIA 13-0  Imperial FURIA let Imperial know who the top dogs are in Brazil with a 13-0 thrashing on Inferno after a wild series with a non-sensical Nuke after a one-sided opener for Vinicius ""VINI"" Figueiredo and company on Dust2. Liquid 0-2  paiN Liquid 0-1  paiN FURIA 5-0  Imperial FURIA are in control on the attacking side of Inferno, having won the first rounds and even getting the last one in a complicated situation as Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo and Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato defended a planted bomb against three retaking CTs. That was... unique. ""I'm done trying to call it and make sense of it all."" Me too, Scrawny, me too. What a weird game, but in the end FURIA send it to map three. Everything is called a rollercoaster game these days, but this was exhibit A: Falcons 11-13  Eternal Fire No words for that one. The comeback was close, Falcons looked set to force overtime, and then... this. Falcons 8-11  Eternal Fire FURIA 10-8  Imperial Imperial reach the lower bombsite in a 5v5 situation and... FURIA just choose not to retake. What is happening? Falcons 7-11  Eternal Fire Oh no, Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer. A comeback effort was looking good until this moment, but Falcons fumbled massively in this post-plant and now Eternal Fire need just two rounds to close.a Imperial 7-8  FURIA Well then... We're back to this. Falcons 5-9  Eternal Fire Falcons 5-7  Eternal Fire A late shutdown of a B split and slight recovery for Falcons means they still have a chance in the second half, but they won't be headed into it in high spirits after dropping round 12 to pistols. Imperial 4-6  FURIA And once Imperial take a timeout, they go on to lose consecutive rounds for the first time in this map. FURIA finally stop the rot with Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros finding an opening and followed it up with a triple heading down the lower bombsite. Falcons 3-6  Eternal Fire The first two maps of this series weren't particularly pretty Counter-Strike, and Dust2 has only been worse. Emil ""Magisk"" Reif is doing his best to hold down B, but repeated splits against him, stellar entries and harassment by Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş, and abuse of Long A are paying dividends for Eternal Fire. The Turkish team started down 0-2 but have given up just one of the last seven rounds, with the window closing for Falcons to find an answer. Imperial 4-4  FURIA Eight rounds in nobody has locked in consecutive round wins, and just now the first timeout of the game has hit from the Imperial side after Conner ""Scrawny"" Girvan and Mohan ""launders"" Govindasamy had this hilarious exchange. Scrawny: ""Eight rounds back and forth! No timeouts! Are there coaches?!"" launders: ""New ones, yeah."" Scrawny: ""Uh, clearly!"" Imperial 3-3  FURIA The Brazilians are going back and forth in a glorious game of tug of war. Forcebuys upon forcebuys have had Conner ""Scrawny"" Girvan and Mohan ""launders"" Govindasamy in giggles as this game goes on. FURIA 2-2  Imperial Nuke has started out in a contentious fashion as the rounds go back and forth. Vinicius ""VINI"" Figueiredo secured the pistol, and then Marcelo ""chelo"" Cespedes took advantage of a scrambling Imperial unsure of where the bomb plant is at first. Imperial mustered a reply, only to get forcebought on again with some Tec-9s in the hands of Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo and Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros. It took a disastrous retake attempt fail from Eternal Fire, but Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer now has a 1vs5 clutch to his name in HLTV's database. It took 11 years and 1,870 recorded officials on HLTV for the Dane to get the accolade, so the least you can do is watch how it went down. Pure domination. Imperial go on a 13-1 run to pick up a statement win on Dust2. Not even a near-loss to a complete eco could stop them as they stormed through to the win after halftime with Lucas ""decenty"" Bacelar and Santino ""try"" Rigal continuing their tear. The duo end the map on a ridiculous 47 kills and 280 ADR combined. Falcons 13-8  Eternal Fire We're headed to a third map after Falcons punished repeated mistakes and poor Lobby setups from Eternal Fire in the second half, with the Turkish team barely keeping their heads above water before they were finally put to bed. Falcons 12-6  Eternal Fire Imperial 9-3  FURIA A 9-1 run to end the half after a pistol round loss is not too shabby. FURIA are playing their first Dust2 in the new lineup and it shows — their early approaches got quickly shut down and after being down two men they never even got to plant the bomb. Falcons 12-5  Falcons Falcons 11-4  Eternal Fire Much like on Vertigo, this is looking over already. Eternal Fire won the pistol but couldn't withstand a well-timed Lobby crunch from Falcons that stole things back. A questionable drop out of Heaven by Buğra ""Calyx"" Arkın in a 2vs2 in the next round saw the Turkish team fumble a chance to reply, and Falcons are now just two rounds from victory. Imperial 5-2  FURIA The newest addition to the Imperial squad is making his impact known as he's racking up multi-kill after multi-kill. try is now on 13-3 after the first seven rounds — a lot of those up against low buys as FURIA have been forcing the issue. Falcons 5-2  Eternal Fire Another early lead from Falcons, but this time they've managed to hold on. It wasn't pretty as they had two A rushes shut down back to back, with a floundered end to the first round and a missed Vent dive to start the next not setting them up for success, but jubilation filled the camp as they recovered from the latter 3vs5 after Eternal Fire took far too long to retake. FalleN to sjokz on skullz's comfort: ""It wasn't too hard for us to get skullz into his comfort zone. The roles he's playing is ones he likes the most. It's more about us finding the way to play that fits everyone."" On Imperial matchup: ""I think it's fun that we have a chance to play them at a big tournament, we don't have a chance to play them that much. It's gonna be a great matchup, they have great players, but I have played with them in the past, so I know their qualities. It's gonna be intense, I hope for a good match and hopefully we win."" Falcons 5-13  Eternal Fire At no point did this map look fair. Falcons never regained ground after their 3-1 start and were left bruised and battered by a superlative Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş, who went 7-1 in opening duels and ended the 18-round map with 10 multi-kills, a 1vsX win, and 24-8 K-D. Falcons better not swap any mice between now and their pick of Nuke, because I can't imagine the mentality is any good right now. Falcons 5-10  Eternal Fire A brief moment of hope after that narrow pistol win, only for it to all come crashing down after a disastrous anti-force buy. This is looking like a wrap. Falcons 5-8  Eternal Fire Falcons 3-5  Eternal Fire We're getting our first look at Eternal Fire on Vertigo since the changes to the map, and they are delivering. It was a strong map for them during their PGL Major Copenhagen campaign but their last official on it dates back to May. However, they haven't missed a beat and are currently in cruise control, coming back from a 1-3 start on the T side by battering Falcons' A defenses round after round. ALTERNATE aTTaX's success was short lived as Complexity took over the game once with a second-round forcebuy win in the second half. As the game got close, Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery proved key in his reading of the German team's rotations away from A and then exploiting the gaps, driving the series home for the American side. The 'local heroes' fall to the lower bracket to face off against the loser of Falcons vs. Eternal Fire, while the winner will go up against Complexity for a spot in the group stage. James ""BanKs"" Banks spoke briefly with Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer in a broadcast interview ahead of Falcons' opening game against Eternal Fire. On mentality coming into Cologne with recent results: ""We're just trying to improve ourselves, one step at a time. We had a chance in the second match against Astralis on Nuke but obviously we didn't take it. We have to look into what went wrong and give it another try here."" On frustrations creeping in and pressure for results: ""We're doing what we can and there is only the pressure you put on yourself. We just try to deal with that, but obviously we all want better results than what we've had."" On losing record against Eternal Fire: ""They are a good team, but when we played them in ENCE it was in the period when we were not good. It was not with the NertZ or the Spinx lineup. ""Here in Falcons, we've had some troubles, both times we played them we lost. Right now they are obviously the favorites because the last two times we played them they beat us, and they have a lot of individual skill in their team."" Complexity 5-7  ALTERNATE aTTaX It's Anubis T side, after all, but the Germans have thrown up another competitive first half. Spurred on by some nice Deagle shots in round 8 and later an Michalis ""awzek"" Napoloni triple in a 2v3, they went on a four-round run to add onto their pistol round and conversions. Four defensive rounds on Ancient and one each on Mirage and Anubis, with one of those being a pistol round victory. Squandered advantages, predictable setups called out by André ""drop"" Abreu, and a flat performance from the usually ever-consistent Rasmus ""sjuush"" Beck will make this a series to forget for HEROIC, but they aren't the only team who has struggled immensely on the CT side in Cologne. It is a successful debut for André ""drop"" Abreu as MIBR's new captain then as they stroll to a confident win over HEROIC in their opening match of the Play-in. HEROIC couldn't convert the win despite stealing the Brazilian team's Ancient pick, and went out of the series with a whimper after falling completely flat on Anubis. A 1vs3 from Guy ""NertZ"" Iluz led to their only CT round in the second half, and they squandered 5vs2 and 5vs3s in the last three rounds to end the series in shameful fashion. Complexity 0-1  ALTERNATE aTTaX Some German engineering behind this one. Complexity 13-7  ALTERNATE aTTaX Until that 1v5, make no mistake, this was a close game. Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli himself was struggling. But clutches change games, and it was all Complexity after that horror show of a round. HEROIC 3-4  MIBR MIBR got a clean 3-0 start on the on Anubis before HEROIC struck back with three of their own. The Brazilians then secured a crucial gun round that can keep them racking up the all-important CT-side rounds on the map Complexity 9-7  ALTERNATE aTTaX We had a 2v5 earlier, so why not a 1v5? Game's gone mad. Complexity 4-4  ALTERNATE aTTaX Deary me, Complexity. Luc ""ArroW"" Oehmke and Paul ""PerX"" von Erdmannsdorff have just humbled them 2v5 to make it a four-round streak for aTTaX. HEROIC 7-13  MIBR HEROIC failed to get a hold on the CT side and MIBR called circles around them, a surprise given the Brazilian team's abysmal 1-5 record on Mirage before this series. The match is now headed to Anubis to break the tie. Complexity 4-0  ALTERNATE aTTaX Four in a row for coL but it's not been completely straightforward. Decent signs from aTTaX in this old-school clash of organizations. Conner ""Scrawny"" Girvan has reminded us of the debut of IEM Katowice's local hero invite, where Rebels took down Cloud9. Could ALTERNATE aTTaX make lightning strike twice? HEROIC 6-6  MIBR Rafael ""saffee"" Costa ended the first half of Mirage the way he started it: with a quad-kill. This time around it was two openers and two more in a 3vs3 retake to secure the round and split the half before switching to the CT side. On a good start: ""It's very important for us because last event, we started shakily so it's a good feeling now."" On being underdogs for Cologne: ""It's better for us that they think we are underdogs. We come here and play the best CS we can."" On moving to Europe: ""In Madrid it's been amazing, we love the weather, it's so hot. Practice here with the best teams in the world makes all the difference. HEROIC 0-2  MIBR MIBR take the lead on Mirage off the back of a quad-kill by Rafael ""saffee"" Costa, which the Brazilians followed up with a clean anti-eco. 9z 13-4  3DMAX That's a paddling. Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez hit another level after that clutch, and it's fitting the in-game leader ended proceedings with a flashy triple kill spraydown. He ends 22-8. 9z 9-3  3DMAX 9z 8-3  3DMAX After losing a 5v3 in shocking fashion, 3DMAX are fighting back with two in a row. Still a long way back with the T side of Nuke looming. HEROIC 13-9  MIBR HEROIC turned it around on the attack, going from a 4-8 deficit to 13-9 on the offensive to secure the Brazilian squad's Ancient pick. The two teams will now head to Mirage, where the European side will be gunning to close it in two. 9z 2-1  3DMAX He's 7-1, and that's despite dropping round two. Do you agree with Lucas ""Bubzkji"" Andersen? HEROIC 4-8  MIBR 16 kills and 133 ADR speak for themselves as Felipe ""insani"" Yuji played circles around HEROIC on the attacking side of Ancient. The Brazilians now go on the CT side to defend their lead in hopes of taking the series lead on their pick. 9z 13-3  3DMAX Franco ""dgt"" Garcia and Matias ""HUASOPEEK"" Ibañez Hernandez are in a rush today, it seems. Convincing for the South Americans. HEROIC 1-3  MIBR HEROIC are fielding Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk in place of Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov, who continues to have problems with his visa, and are off to the races against MIBR on the Brazilian team's map pick, Ancient. The series will continue on Mirage and, if necessary, go to Anubis for the decider. 9z 10-2  3DMAX 3DMAX have got nothing going on their usual stronghold of Anubis. 9z have all their key men firing with star man Franco ""dgt"" Garcia on 15 frags and 142 ADR at the break. To make matters worse, Matias ""HUASOPEEK"" Ibañez Hernandez grabs four in the second pistol. 9z 4-0  3DMAX Three of our writers think so, and it's been a great start for 9z. Visa issues have given Skyesports Championship winners 3DMAX a chance to continue their strong form at IEM Cologne. Tough first test vs IEM Dallas semi-finalists 9z. FlyQuest 11-13  BIG BIG avoided a massive choke as they won the last two rounds of regulation in the Vertigo decider, which they started with a 10-0 lead, to close it 13-11. FlyQuest 10-11  BIG FlyQuest continue to march towards a comeback after Joshua ""INS"" Potter won a 1vs2 clutch to bring it within one round. FlyQuest 7-11  BIG FlyQuest are scrappily continuing to work towards a comeback, although it's not always pretty. FlyQuest 4-10  BIG After a disastrous CT half, which went to BIG 10-2, FlyQuest won a crucial pistol round and followed it up to keep their comeback dream alive. They did do it on Ancient, from a 3-9 deficit to an overtime victory. On the win: ""They have a lot of skill, but we felt like in practice we were improving a lot. Today we had a really good day, we were just better."" On Dust2: ""We felt really calm on T side, making decisions, and everything went really well."" On the pillows behind the chairs: ""I've been playing for so long, I need to look down on the monitor and get higher."" The MongolZ 5-13  SAW Great moments from both Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto and Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing, the key young duo for SAW as The MongolZ get absolutely destroyed. FlyQuest 0-4  BIG After chaotic forcebuys in the first maps, finally some calm on Vertigo. BIG have established the pace on the attack and are off to a clean 5-0 with methodical T-side play. The MongolZ 1-8  SAW Only a Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren double from A Ramp and a good effort in an eco at 1-6 has even slightly troubled SAW nine rounds in. This is an absolute battering. The MongolZ 1-4  SAW Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto, like he did so often on Anubis, is finding the gaps in this MongolZ defence. The economy is in tatters — still early, but The MongolZ have a lot of work to do. FlyQuest 10-13  BIG BIG came out on top on the attack and force a third map in the series. Both teams have taken each other's pick and Vertigo will be the map to decide who moves onto the qualifying match and who goes down to the elimination bracket. The MongolZ 13-5  SAW If SAW and Danny ""BERRY"" Krüger had any tricks we didn't get to see them. Business as usual for The MongolZ, who went on a 12-1 streak since that early tech pause. The MongolZ 8-4  SAW The MongolZ have kept it basic on the T side but keep winning the Mid fights. An Anubis-esque miracle needed for SAW on the T side comeback. The MongolZ 5-4  SAW The tech pause gave The MongolZ a moment to steady themselves, as this game was getting away from them. Back in the lead now. Volodymyr ""Woro2k"" Veletniuk is in action next, for HEROIC against MIBR The MongolZ 1-3  SAW Oh no, Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar. He'd started this round so well with a 3K after that horror show on map one. But he gifts SAW back the round with an overpeek and whiff in this 2on1. The MongolZ 1-2  SAW You can tell SAW have been preparing for this match for a while. So on The MongolZ's best and most-picked map, what could be in store? FlyQuest 2-1  BIG We're off to another wild start, this time on Inferno, as FlyQuest's pistol win was followed up by two forcebuys going either way. A great map for João ""story"" Vieira, who has been a bit quieter in recent months since SAW first broke out at the RMR with their new young trio. In case you missed that 4K: The MongolZ 13-16  SAW The MongolZ just could not deal with SAW's offence, forced into 3-0-2 and 2-0-3 setups to try and stem the bleeding, only for Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto to punish them by walking through Middle. A masterclass from Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes and Danny ""BERRY"" Krüger once we switched sides at 4-8. On the other side, it's one to forget for The MongolZ's star man Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar. He tried aggression, he tried holding back, he even tried the AWP, but his B bomb-site fell time after time. Hopefully none of you picked him for $222,000 in fantasy. FlyQuest 16-14  BIG Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi soared with his aggression, pushing through a smoke and downing three unsuspecting defenders to tie things up 14-14, but alas it was not enough as FlyQuest won a contested Mid push to hit map point before closing it out 16-14. The Aussies bagged BIG's map pick and go up 1-0 in the series ahead of Inferno. The MongolZ 12-12  SAW The MongolZ recover just in time, thanks to five kills in two rounds from Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold (who is up to 24 kills now). FlyQuest 12-12  BIG Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische, who made the mistake that put FlyQuest on map point, downed three with the AWP in the final round of regulation to make sure the map keeps going into extra rounds. The MongolZ 10-11  SAW What a T side from SAW! The B site gets completely firebombed and they make it 7-2 for the half so far. You can see the impact of Danny ""BERRY"" Krüger on the Portuguese team's map pick. The MongolZ are still relying on individual plays like this quad from Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch to get anything done, but that B execute has them back where they started. FlyQuest 12-10  BIG Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische gave up a silly kill with a repeek and gave Alistair ""aliStair"" Johnston the chance to clutch a 1vs1 against Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi to hit map point. rigoN then came up big the following round as BIG almost threw a 4vs2, clutching a 1vs2 of his own to keep his team alive. The MongolZ 9-9  SAW The Mongolian B site is taking a pummeling, and economy struggles since losing the second pistol are taking their toll. The only CT round The MongolZ have won came from that Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold A Main push. The MongolZ 9-7  SAW Everyone's favorite cherub had a great double entry onto the A bomb-site earlier in the game, and he now has a round-winning CT double to match. FlyQuest 9-9  BIG BIG took a hefty lead on the attack, going up 9-3 at the half, but FlyQuest are making a great recovery on the T side, winning six in a row to bring it back even. The MongolZ 6-3  SAW Two gun rounds in a row for SAW now, but they needed heroics from João ""story"" Vieira on the Bridge to get the second. FlyQuest 3-7  BIG Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi's aggression is having an impact on the T side as he squeezed past a smoke on Ramp and opened up the B site to keep BIG in the lead. The MongolZ 4-1  SAW A second round victory for SAW threatened to drag this game into the mud of back-and-forth force wars. But The MongolZ have stabilized with Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren on three multi-kills already. FlyQuest 2-3  BIG FlyQuest and BIG are off to a high-octane start in a match that has already seen several roller coaster rounds. One of them was a 1vs3 afterplant clutch by Christopher ""dexter"" Nong. The series, which kicked off on BIG's Ancient pick, will continue on Inferno and, if necessary, finish on a Vertigo decider. On having BERRY and speaking English: ""It's important that he understands if we're going crazy. But it's not really a problem."" ""The end of the season was a bit tough for us, we weren't used to being on big stages and we were a bit tired. But it's not an excuse. The big teams play every event, they don't have time to practice. Right now, we have a lot of energy."" HLTV's writers were hard at work in the run-up to one of the biggest events on the calendar, from the tournament's talking points to newsroom predictions, and other stories that will unfold as the tournament plays out over the next 12 days. IEM Cologne is about to kick off with the play-in coming up first. Sixteen teams are fighting for eight spots in the group stage in this preliminary round.

Complexity beat VP in IEM Cologne group opener,https://www.hltv.org/news/39579/complexity-beat-vp-in-iem-cologne-group-opener,"Virtus.pro drop down to the Group B lower bracket after the loss. Complexity have defeated Virtus.pro in the opening round of the IEM Cologne group stage in three maps (Vertigo 13-6, Dust2 14-16, Anubis 13-5) to move on in the upper bracket of Group B. The North Americans now move on to face the winner of MOUZ vs. Falcons, while Virtus.pro will play the loser of the same match for their tournament lives. The game was a rematch of their Esports World Cup clash, where Virtus.pro barely broke a sweat in a 2-0 victory, but today's match went comfortably in Complexity's favor. ""We've been progressing throughout the tournament, we have more direction and initiative,"" said a smiling Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski. ""Last time we lost against them, but we were horrible, so I'm happy we got the win now."" The series began on Vertigo, where an EliGE-powered offensive half netted Complexity a 9-3 lead. The turning moment came in the eighth round when Michael ""Grim"" Wince won a 1v3 with Complexity's money at breaking point, which put clear daylight between them and Virtus.pro. The Russian squad showed signs of life late on, but their anti-eco woes meant they could only muster six rounds. Clip: Grim wins 1v3 to keep Complexity ahead on Vertigo Virtus.pro started their Dust2 T-side well and ran away to a 5-2 lead but couldn't adapt once Complexity brought out the double AWP, as they faltered to a 5-7 deficit. The game remained scrappy throughout and needed overtime to decide the winner, when Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov finally found some impact and clutched a crucial 1v2 in the penultimate round to deliver the map for his team. Anubis began with a pair of clutches by EliGE and Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery, which allowed Complexity to take the first half with an 8-4 scoreline. The T-sided nature of Anubis then helped Complexity breeze to a comfortable 13-5 victory to continue their good form from the play-in.

"SAW play ""beautiful"" Counter-Strike to upset G2",https://www.hltv.org/news/39580/saw-play-beautiful-counter-strike-to-upset-g2,"The Portuguese side was a cut above G2 and is now just one win away from LANXESS Arena. SAW are on the warpath in Cologne and remain undefeated after scoring a statement victory over G2 in their group stage opener, outclassing Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski's side on Nuke (13-5) and recovering from a deficit on Inferno (13-10) to advance to the upper bracket semi-final of Group A. The Portuguese team surprised in the Play-in by advancing undefeated with wins over The MongolZ and BIG, but make no mistake here: this was as legitimate of an underdog victory as you can get, with Mohan ""launders"" Govindasamy going so far as to call it ""one of the best underdog performances ever"" and ""one of the most beautiful games of Counter-Strike"" he's seen from an underdog. The defeat casts G2 down to a cutthroat lower bracket, where they will first take on the loser of Spirit vs. The MongolZ and then have two more best-of-threes to win in order to reach the LANXESS to defend their crown. In a post-game broadcast interview, Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere discussed the win with Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing, with the rifler stating what was clear as day for anyone who caught the game live: SAW were well-prepared for G2. ""We expected to win Nuke because we have a strong Nuke and have been practicing a lot, and we expected them to pick Inferno too. It was a bit shaky on our side, but we worked a lot to prepare their pick and it went great, 2-0, and that's awesome. ""People think we are a bad team,"" he added about SAW's run thus far. ""We are working our asses off and we are showing it, and let's see what else."" SAW's win was emphatic, starting with a masterclass T side on Nuke wherein G2 were given no opportunity to get into the game. Rounds were over moments after they began as the Portuguese team found entry after entry to resign G2 to saves, and three multi-kill rounds from Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto after the side swap ensured the map ended as a statement win, 13-5. Clip: ewjerkz makes the FAMAS look good (3K) G2 turned the tables on Inferno, an early string of rounds from SAW fading off in the distance after Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač and the rest of his team repeatedly annihilated SAW in opening duels to lead 7-3. SAW gave themselves a lifeline with two rounds at the end of the half, and that buffer proved crucial after G2 rapidly hit double digits after the side swap, 10-5. With Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač warming up and momentum in G2's hands, the map could well have been over at this point. However, SAW clamped down and showed masterful mentality and teamplay, completely outclassing and outmaneuvering G2 to go on an eight-round run and steal away the victory.",10-8-2024 18:30,1723307400000
Astralis score opening victory over 9z,https://www.hltv.org/news/39581/astralis-score-opening-victory-over-9z,"After a close first map, the Danish side dominated to close out the series. Astralis have kicked off their IEM Cologne 2024 campaign with a straightforward victory, besting LATAM side 9z in swift 2-0 fashion. As a reward for their victory, Astralis are now scheduled for an upper-bracket semi-final versus the winner of the series between Natus Vincere and paiN, while 9z are slated to face off against the loser of the aforementioned series for their tournament lives. ""When you hit that flow state, it's just really easy, you just let them do the mistakes,"" shared Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard after his team's victory. ""You don't really have to do anything, to be honest."" Astralis capitalizing on 9z's mistakes proved to be a common trend on both maps of the series, kicking off on Dust2 with a force-buy upset after missing out on the first pistol round. 9z soon equalized, but an eco-hunt gone wrong allowed for Astralis to carry over four rifles, jumpstarting their economy to help them take control of the half. Clip: buda 1v3 helps keep the first half close The second half quickly devolved into a back-and-forth affair after Astralis failed to convert their pistol round win, eventually tying up with a 10-10 scoreline. Back-to-back clutches from Alexander ""br0"" Bro proved to be the difference-maker, allowing Astralis to steal away their opponent's pick 13-10. The Danish side's pick of Inferno was not even remotely as close, as the only two rounds that 9z managed to procure in the first half were the pistol and subsequent conversion as Astralis displayed an impeccable T-side.

FaZe beat Liquid 2-0 on Saturday to get their IEM Cologne campaign off on the right foot, inflicting the first loss on Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken as an IGL. The victory comes as a significant boost for FaZe, given their recent struggles. They are currently ranked sixth in the world, and their latest tournament runs ended in disappointment. At the BLAST Premier Fall Groups, they were knocked out by Ninjas in Pyjamas, which Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen said was ""not good enough"" for the caliber of players on the team. Still, Filip ""NEO"" Kubski sees no reason for panic. The Polish coach believes that the team can bounce back, and he praised the amount of work everyone put in for Cologne. ""It's been what, a couple of months? So it's not like a lot of things have changed,"" he said. ""It's not easy to grind it back, because everything moves forward and things change, more teams step up, but it's not impossible."" Most people would say that FaZe have just an outside chance of winning Cologne, but NEO isn't writing his team off, stating that this event is ""a top priority"" for the team. ""We did everything we could before coming here to just make it happen and play our best."" NEO, a 2-0 victory in your first match in this tournament. How important was it, considering the recent results, to get off to a winning start here in Cologne? I would say extremely important. We've been working very hard to get back. Also, the atmosphere around the team is not perfect. And many people stopped believing in us at some point. There was a moment when everybody was just thinking we were going to reach the finals each time, and then we started dropping off a little bit. Then there was the player break. We didn't come back strong from this one. But it's constant work, and we've been grinding a lot and it was really important to win this one. You said that many people have stopped believing in the team, but do you still see that belief in the players? Or do you think it's a little bit difficult to judge that, considering the latest results? I mean, not so long ago, we were at the top of the scene. It's extremely competitive and there are so many great teams. But just as fast as you drop, you can grind it back. It's been what, a couple of months? So it's not like a lot of things have changed. It's not easy to grind it back, because everything moves forward and things change, more teams step up, but it's not impossible, especially with this team, with these guys, they're all capable of playing extremely good CS. It all just has to connect. Like I said, we've been putting in more work. This was only the first game. Let's see the next ones. Can you walk me through the series? I guess Mirage were trying to capitalize on some of your weaknesses on Mirage in recent games, but you were able to find some success on the A site as Terrorists. And then on Nuke, you had a very strong performance on the CT side. Nuke is the map we used to pick the most. That used to be our comfort pick. We were thinking about leaning towards other maps, but this it made more sense to just pick it. Actually, we were surprised with their Mirage pick, because it didn't feel like it was going to happen. So we got to play two really good maps of ours. At some point, we were really good on them. So yeah, it was just a solid game from us. I think we had a really good team performance. It was not like one guy was carrying the team, everybody stepped up at some point and we had good comms and good energy. Even though we made mistakes during the game, we still managed to win. It's all about mistakes, right? Who is going to make more of them. This time, we came out on top. Talking about the map pool, Anubis was by far the most played map during the Play-in. That's a map you guys almost never play. How do you see that playing out in the vetos moving forward? And do you think that maybe that's a map you guys are considering playing? We've been practicing it a lot. There are different opinions on the map inside the team, but I'm really hoping for someone to finally pick it, because I believe we're capable of playing really good CS there. We banned it this time, so they couldn't do it. But yeah, maybe next time we'll get the chance to play it. You had just one week to prepare for this tournament after coming out of the BLAST Groups. In the pre-match interview, karrigan said that you tried to change some things, set a new foundation, a new play style. What can you say about this new FaZe and how different is it compared to the old one? If you look at it from a different perspective, it's new old FaZe, I would say, because things were working out at some point. karrigan is such an experienced player and IGL, he's been through rough times in the past and he bounced back. So he knows how to handle those situations. Of course, we've been struggling a little bit in the last couple of weeks, months. But, like I said, it's constant work and trying to find the solutions to the problems. Normally, there are more problems than just one. So, yeah, just trying to stay together as a team, connect and work on all of the stuff. You worked with Twistzz for a while at the beginning of your time with FaZe. What is your opinion about the current Liquid roster and were you surprised when you learned that Twistzz was becoming an IGL? You could always say he was able to be a caller. I mean, that's what happens with a lot of star players. For example, there are rounds when they play on a team with a different IGL and they help him make calls sometimes. When Russ played on the team, he was able to call for the team. So I knew he was capable of doing that, and he understands the game so much. As players grow and develop their game with experience, I think that some of them, at some point, are able to transition into IGLs, and I think that it was just the perfect time for him to do that, with Liquid struggling under cadiaN's leadership. After watching them play under Russ' leadership, he's been doing a great job. He's a smart guy, so I'm not surprised they're doing really well because they've got a pretty nice lineup. I'm happy to see a Polish guy, ultimate, on the team. Looking forward to cheering for them, because they're nice guys. Considering how rough the past couple of months have been for the team, did you set any goals for this tournament? What would you be satisfied with? At the beginning of the year, and a couple of months later, when talking about goals, after the Major, I think Cologne and Katowice are the biggest goals for every team. And especially with the current situation with the Grand Slam, I think Cologne is a top priority for the team, and we did everything we could before coming here to just make it happen and play our best.",10-8-2024 17:15,1723302900000
IEM Cologne Play-in day 3 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39565/iem-cologne-play-in-day-3-as-it-happened,"""The last time we played against them on Vertigo it was 13-0, so I said just win the knife and we win the game,"" Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt said about the final map. Confident wors right there. A dominant third map is more than enough to send paiN to the next stage. MIBR had a chance but lost a 2v5 situation late on, which proved to be the final nail in the coffin, as they lost 13-3. paiN 11-3  MIBR paiN 8-3  MIBR paiN 5-1  MIBR Five rounds off the back of a second-round forcebuy for paiN, who are looking like themselves after a quiet Anubis. Who else but Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt is leading the way, with João ""snow"" Vinicius joining his captain. MAJ3R on the desk on the Nuke disappointment: ""I think it's on me, T side Nuke I didn't find a lot of solutions, they started with the AWPs and I focused my game plan on inner because of that, but it didn't work really well. I apologize to my teammates and all the fans."" Eternal Fire returned to their failed upper hits and The MongolZ were more than ready, getting the read on them before they even began. Once on the T side, a slow, patient play outside and a crunch on heaven put the Mongolians on 15, and they closed with a rush down ramp to lower. Eternal Fire 12-12  The MongolZ He started it and he seems set on ending it. Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş says let me handle this, goes searching in yard to find two openers, and then follows it up with a triple in the final round to take it to overtime. paiN 4-13  MIBR Dominance from start to finish, and MIBR have forced the decider of Vertigo. paiN could only muster four rounds, two of which came from the pistol, and now need a factory reset for Vertigo. Eternal Fire 10-11  The MongolZ Some head-scratching hits towards the upper bombsite from Eternal Fire, with the players running in one by one, have given The MongolZ control of the game as it reaches the late stages. Eternal Fire 10-8  The MongolZ Look at this decision from the Turks. They had enough for a much better buy — Buğra ""Calyx"" Arkın could have even dropped — but instead went with a triple SMG run down ramp. And it worked. Eternal Fire 9-6  The MongolZ First the Mongolians claimed a clean second-round forcebuy win and then Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar and Sodbayar ""Techno"" Munkhbold combined up against Eternal Fire's force of their own to turn a 2v4 around. We've got a game on our hands. Eternal Fire 9-4  The MongolZ He secures the pistol round almost all on his own with a quad-kill and clutch, opening up the round and then finishing it off in a hairy situation on the lower site. paiN 1-7  MIBR This CT half has been rough for paiN. Rafael ""saffee"" Costa has been dominant and sits on a 7-0 K-D, with Felipe ""insani"" Yuji and Raphael ""exit"" Lacerda providing the rifle firepower. Eternal Fire 8-4  The MongolZ Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş is on 18-4 now, constantly searching aggressing for fights and winning most of them before backing off, prompting Hugo to go, ""He can't keep getting away with it..."" The MongolZ found a couple of pistol wins at the end of this half, which might be a saving grace down the line, but they're still far behind up against the 29-year-old's rampage. Eternal Fire 3-1  The MongolZ Yep. He's on fire again. Eternal Fire 2-0  The MongolZ Some nice shots in the pistol and a triple up against the following eco, and Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş' confidence is back on track after the lackluster map two. paiN 10-13  MIBR Who else but Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt to take his tem over the line after they had trouble closing it out. He sneaks through WIndow and finds three kills on the B site, and paiN are a map up as they go into their pick of Anubis. Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş had a rare off performance on the second map of the series. The MongolZ 13-8  Eternal Fire It's an anti-climactic end to a map that could have perhaps gotten interesting otherwise. After losing the opening pick, the Turks head into an A stack and Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold destroys them with the Deagle. We're heading to the deciding Nuke. paiN 5-9  MIBR Another 1v2, this time for the paiN side. The MongolZ 10-4  Eternal Fire Eternal Fire's star is not exactly used to having off maps, but he's having one right now and it's clear from the player cameras that he's on edge. The MongolZ 8-4  Eternal Fire Buğra ""Calyx"" Arkın and Engin ""MAJ3R"" Küpeli have found some impact with good reads at the end of the CT side to recover the 0-7 start and give themselves a chance on the second map. paiN 5-5  MIBR A scrappy affair so far, and Felipe ""insani"" Yuji has just kept MIBR in it with a 1v2. The MongolZ 5-0  Eternal Fire It's been a hell of a lot closer than the scoreline suggests. The MongolZ had to fend off a difficult round two anti-force and only barely survived it after Engin ""MAJ3R"" Küpeli missed the mark from behind, then won a 3v5, and just barely escaped another round against just pistols with their lives. But close only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades, and the Turks will have to win one of these sooner rather than later. Domination from start to finish as Eternal Fire pick up a statement win on their own map pick to kick off the do-or-die series. Mirage is next, a map the Turks haven't played since late May. Falcons 13-10  BIG It wasn't pretty, and Falcons' reaction after the win says it all. Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García should get a round of shots at the bar later tonight from his teammates, as his standout performance was the reason for their victory. Eternal Fire 10-2  The MongolZ This T half on Anubis has been in complete Turkish control and this next-to-last round only served as salt in the wound. A terrible miss from Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren from behind means the Mongolians throw away the chance at a decent score before they get their chance on the offense. Falcons 11-8  BIG BIG tried to do something similar on Dust2 and failed, but they are looking much better this time around. Four rounds in a row mean they are just three away, and Falcons are down to an eco in the next. Falcons 8-4  BIG BIG haven't found much success since winning the pistol. Just one gun round to their name is all they have to show for, and Falcons are five rounds away from the group stage. Falcons 2-4  BIG It's currently Florian ""syrsoN"" Rische and Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García leading the way for their teams as they fight for early control. BIG won the pistol, and are currently sporting a healthy two-round lead. FURIA are through to the group stage after a chaotic end to Nuke that nearly saw them throw the chance to end it away in the penultimate round (see below). Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros stepped up again with a triple on the A bombsite in the final round to close it. HEROIC are out in the first stage after this. Oh no... A massive fumble from FURIA. HEROIC 10-12  FURIA ""I'm not down, guys, I'm not down..."" Tough round to lose for HEROIC as they're up against match point with no money. Falcons 10-13  BIG All thanks go to Rigon ""rigoN"" Gashi's Deagle, which delivered a crucial 4k that got BIG back into the game. Since that momentum swing, the Germans lost just one round and have now forced the decider of Anubis. HEROIC 9-8  FURIA A respectable attempt from Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski, but Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato stayed calm under the time pressure and called out the IGL in the final 1v1. That's a crucial halfbuy win that goes the way of the Brazilians after HEROIC began to take over the T side. Falcons 9-9  BIG Falcons 9-8  BIG Falcons are less comfortable on Mirage than on Dust2, but are still able to get crucial rounds when it matters. Álvaro ""SunPayus"" Garcíais still fragging, and Falcons are four rounds away from the group stage. HEROIC 7-5  FURIA His 9-6 scoreline may not fully show it, but Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski has been crucial to this successful defensive half from HEROIC on Nuke. MId-round pushes from the Macedonian IGL were crucial to them in the 7-2 run that allowed them to grab the lead at the half. Similarly on the other side, Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros is not on top of the board but had two crucial rounds to keep FURIA in this. Falcons 7-5  BIG BIG gave it a go in the opening few rounds, but a resurgent Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García is proving too much for the German squad. The majority-Danish squad are two rounds ahead despite Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer not contributing in the fragging department — the Dane sits on two frags after the first half. FURIA 2-0  HEROIC The awkward upper hit was met with a firm resistance and Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros came to save the day at the final hour. Falcons 2-0  BIG Emil ""Magisk"" Reif proved to be the hero of a Falcons B rush that got awkward pretty quickly. ESL has already seeded some of the Play-in teams into the groups and it has produced a couple of spicy matchups, the most high-octane being between FaZe and Liquid in Group B. Here are the groups so far: Group A Natus Vincere vs. TBD Astralis vs.  9z G2 vs.  SAW Spirit vs. TBD Group B MOUZ vs. TBD Virtus.pro vs.  Complexity FaZe vs.  Liquid Vitality vs. TBD HEROIC finally found the recipe to the CT side and closed it with three in a row with René ""TeSeS"" Madsen and Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski making all the difference in the closing. Nuke to decide. Falcons 13-7  BIG It started to get close, but Falcons closed it out after a last-second A attack. A win on their opponent's map pick is a good omen for the rest of the series, which now moves to Mirage. BIG's last win on Mirage was in August 2023, by the way. HEROIC 10-8  FURIA From down 10-4 the Brazilians have won four in a row off the back of a 1v2 clutch from an overlooked Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros on the B bombsite. HEROIC now on the back foot economically and it's getting to a point where they could lose this from the big lead. Falcons 12-4  BIG Can they do it? Probably not, but stranger things have happened. They won two in a row, however, and Falcons are down to a full eco. Guy ""NertZ"" Iluz is on 15-6 and has led the charge by quite some distance for an 8-4 half on Anubis. Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov was rather quiet but stepped up when he was needed most with a 1v2 that allowed the European team to rack up a solid lead. Falcons 10-2  BIG Just two rounds for BIG on their offense, and it's just about as much as they deserve. Nothing really went the way of the German squad, with Emil ""Magisk"" Reif and Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković posting over 120 ADR in the opening half. HEROIC 4-2  FURIA ""That's just one of those rounds where you have to scratch your head and take a step back,"" Adam ""Dinko"" Hawthorne comments as HEROIC somehow find the perfect way to a free bombsite. BIG 1-6  Falcons After not impressing against ALTERNATE aTTaX yesterday, Falcons are playing much more proactive today. A ballsy three-man push into tunnels just got them their sixth of the half and broke BIG's economy again. HEROIC 3-1  FURIA That took me back a few years! BIG 1-3  Falcons BIG won the pistol, but a couple of saucy Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García shots on the Scout got Falcons back in control. Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks ahead of their do-or-die clash against BIG. On win against ALTERNATE aTTaX: ""We are not at our peak form, and we aren't playing that good. We are just trying to get the confidence back, but a win is a win."" On BIG match: ""I think we are favorites against BIG. We need to understand we have really good players, and I think we are just better than them. Everyone is feeling confident, if we beat BIG it's going to be really important for us to make it to Cologne and get some better results."" FURIA 13-11  HEROIC What a crazy couple of rounds to end the map. Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov pulls a near-impossible 1v2 out of the hat to keep HEROIC alive, only for them to then throw the chance to send it to overtime away as Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros and Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato turned a 2v5 situation around to secure the first map. degster 1v2 KSCERATO and skullz 2v5 paiN just can't lose to Imperial, that's now six series in a row they have taken against their regional rivals. paiN were the more polished team in gun rounds across the whole series, but Imperial dug deep and found big plays when they needed to keep the match close up until Inferno. The final map was a comfortably affair ultimately for paiN, they were far more polished on both halves. Imperial's T side was a little too simplistic, and their utility usage was not up to scratch on the CT side. paiN now progress to a lower bracket bout with MIBR, with a spot in the group stage on the line. FURIA 10-9  HEROIC Neither FURIA or HEROIC could find the way to break free, but now the Brazilians won a forcebuy with a quick A hit that broke the CTs' economy, putting them in a great position ahead of the final rounds of the map. paiN 12-6  Imperial paiN 11-4  Imperial Seems this game is close to being done. Imperial just aren't as polished on Inferno as paiN. FURIA 8-5  HEROIC Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros, with three opening kills and as many multi-kill rounds had a great CT side, even hitting 100 ADR at the switch, had a great half as FURIA doubled HEROIC's score at the switch, 8-4. HEROIC won the second pistol, however, to make sure FURIA don't run away with the map before they have a say on the defense. paiN 8-4  Imperial paiN in the driver's seat. Imperial's gameplan of pressure B, then see-saw back to A, was a little too predictable, but some firepower and tidy trading earned them some rounds to play with. Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk pulled off a nifty flank to help paiN on their way, but my lord he struggled to decide exactly how he was going to mow them down... FURIA 5-0  HEROIC FURIA are off to a big 5-0 start on the CT side of Mirage, HEROIC's map pick, although the Europeans already showed their teeth by almost converting on a forcebuy that ended in a 2vs2 afterplant situation on A. paiN 4-0  Imperial paiN are starting this CT side in solid fashion, although they probably should have dealt with the A push clipped below a little better. paiN 2-0  Imperial Tech pause number two. Hopefully this one is shorter, we will bring you any updates. paiN 1-0  Imperial We're underway! No sign of when this game will get underway, but the tech pause has gone on for some time now. Edit: It seems it may be related to a FACEIT anti-cheat issue, as per this tweet. paiN 13-10  Imperial It seemed paiN were on their way to an easy Vertigo win, after strong starts to both halves, but they squandered a seemingly unlosable 3v2 mid-way through the second half to allow Imperial back into contention. Santino ""try"" Rigal's AWP found some purchase, Kaiky ""noway"" Santos found some strong openings, but paiN rallied at the right time to get over the line. Shout out to Lucas ""nqz"" Soares, who had a stormer of a map. 9z 13-2  MIBR 9z made quick work of MIBR on Nuke after a nailbiter on Ancient and have secured their place at the IEM Cologne group stage. 9z 10-2  MIBR 9z have smashed their way through the T side of Nuke and have a foot and a half in the IEM Cologne group stage after a 10-2 half on the attacking side of their map pick. Raphael ""exit"" Lacerda did his best to pick apart some overconfident peeks late in the half, but was stopped by a brilliant Franco ""dgt"" Garcia, who otherwise has had a quiet series. paiN 10-8  Imperial Pressure is building on paiN now, they really should have won that round and virtually sealed the map. paiN 10-6  Imperial paiN 7-5  Imperial Imperial looked lost at the start of their defensive effort, and paiN were potent in finding openings, particularly Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk. A switch to grouping up more helped Imperial trade their way into a string of rounds at the end of the half, but considering their woeful T side record on Vertigo in recent times, five rounds is probably not enough. 9z 4-1  MIBR 9z 3-1  MIBR 9z got off to a great start winning the first pistol round on the T side, but gave up two kills in Yard on the first gun round to give MIBR the chance to get into the fight early. paiN 5-0  Imperial 9z 16-13  MIBR 9z found enough gas in the tank to bring it to overtime after a rough patch on the attack and went on to steal the Brazilian side's map pick in overtime, 16-13, and head to their Nuke map pick just one map win away from securing a spot at the IEM Cologne group stage. 9z 12-12  MIBR 9z got the best of MIBR with the map on the line, going on to win a close 3vs3 bomb defense on B to force extra rounds. paiN 10-13  Imperial paiN had done the hard work to get themselves back into the map, but rotated away from the Long attack with zero map control and no time on the clock, throwing a round away to a bad buy and eventually the map with it too. Imperial really benefitted from going 6-0 in pistol rounds and conversions, otherwise they probably lose the map as paiN were the better team in gun rounds. Vertigo, paiN's pick, up next. 9z 9-10  MIBR MIBR are in the lead after a four-round streak which has left 9z looking lifeless as they have managed only two kills in three rounds (albeit one was a full eco). paiN 10-11  Imperial Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk had been having a stinker up until this point, but a vital 3k holding the line in a 3v4 might have just turned the map in favour of his team. 9z 9-6  MIBR MIBR are fighting to keep things close with a forcebuy victory after losing the pistol. After cancelling a fast A hit, 9z walked into a setup outside of B and paid the price losing the second round against pistols. 9z hit right back in the following round with a mix of rifles and pistols to keep fighting for control of the economy. paiN 6-10  Imperial A vital moment for Santino ""try"" Rigal. His team had thrown away their lives repeatedly to almost choke away a 5v3, but he saved the day. paiN 6-6  Imperial Imperial bagged four rounds early doors to kick their offense off with a bang, but paiN righted the ship and managed to split the half down the middle. Vinicius ""VINI"" Figueiredo did well early for Imperial finding entries towards Long, but once that dried up, his team had a harder time of things. paiN 2-4  Imperial 9z 1-3  MIBR The series is off to the races with MIBR up 3-1 on their Ancient map pick. A double by Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez with an M4A1-S while his teammates were on a forcebuy, and a third to close the round out, put 9z on the board after they went down by three. The series will continue on Nuke, 9z's pick, with Mirage in the chamber in case a decider is needed after two. paiN 0-3  Imperial Advantage Imperial early doors after securing their T side pistol. Ten team are still in contention to continue their journey in Cologne, but only five spots for the main event are left to be claimed. A pair of South American battles will kick off the day, with the loser of the 9z vs. MIBR game heading down to the lower bracket to face off against the winner of Imperial vs. paiN. Next up a raft of household names will fight for their group stage berth, with BIG, Falcons, FURIA and HEROIC all in the mix. Closing out today's play will be a fascinating matchup between The MongolZ and Eternal Fire, and the aforementioned South American lower bracket bout.",9-8-2024 23:24,1723238640000
The MongolZ upset sets up Spirit-G2 elimination match,https://www.hltv.org/news/39582/the-mongolz-upset-sets-up-spirit-g2-elimination-match,"The reigning Cologne champions will square off against the reigning Katowice winners in the lower bracket. The final matches of the first day of IEM Cologne's main stage have drawn to a close, seeing The MongolZ move past the Russian heavyweights of Spirit in a shocking 2-0 victory, while Natus Vincere made light work of paiN to continue on through the upper bracket. The MongolZ's surprising victory over Spirit has damning ramifications, as the latter side is now slated to face off against G2 for their tournament lives after the international side also found themselves in the lower bracket after enduring an upset of their own against SAW. While one of the reigning Cologne or Katowice champions is locked in for elimination tomorrow, either SAW or The MongolZ are guaranteed to play in the LANXESS Arena thanks to their impressive upsets. The two underdogs previously met in the Play-in, where the Portuguese squad pulled through in a close three-map series. Meanwhile, Natus Vincere's win over paiN has secured them a matchup versus Astralis for a place in playoffs, while the Brazilians will be facing fellow South American side 9z in their lower bracket elimination match. The MongolZ's series versus Spirit kicked off on the former side's pick of Ancient, a map that that Spirit are known to be capable on. Although the Mongolian side managed to procure an early lead, this was soon whittled away by occasional heroics from Spirit's men, leading to a tied-up score at the half. A pistol-round clutch from Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov allowed the Russian to claim the lead, but two losses to poor buys from The MongolZ had drastic consequences for the rest of the half, as it allowed Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren's men to drag the map into overtime. Clip: bLitz braves the flames to secure overtime The MongolZ then ran away with things in the extra set of rounds, locking down their map pick with a 16-13 scoreline thanks in part to heroic rounds from their captain and a superlative performance from Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold. Things started in a competitive fashion on Spirit's choice of Anubis, but poor grenades, lackluster spacing, and unfortunate timings from the Russian side gave The MongolZ room to run away with the match, stealing away Anubis with a stunning 13-4 scoreline to take the series 2-0. Meanwhile, Natus Vincere hardly broke a sweat in their series versus paiN, overcoming an early deficit on the Brazilian's pick of Anubis to mop up a quick 13-4 win. Natus Vincere did more of the same on Mirage, exposing the gaps in paiN's defense to claim a dominant first half before eventually finishing things off with another 13-4 scoreline, bagging their tenth-consecutive win on Mirage.",10-8-2024 21:39,1723318740000
"Techno: ""A really big achievement for us""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39583/techno-a-really-big-achievement-for-us,"The 19-year-old was over the moon after his team upset Spirit in the opening round of IEM Cologne. The MongolZ pulled off the second upset of IEM Cologne's group stage as they moved past Spirit in just two maps, putting the current world No.2 on the brink of elimination. The Mongolians' marquee performance was made all the more surprising by the fact that they appeared to be losing some steam after winning YaLLa Compass in early June. After early exits at ESL Challenger Jönköping and the Esports World Cup, they were outclassed by 3DMAX in the grand final of the Skyesports Championship - the team's last event before Cologne. ""It's a really big achievement for us,"" Sodbayar ""Techno"" Munkhbold told HLTV after the match. ""We're feeling so happy right now. ""We played them in the Katowice Play-Ins and lost 2-0. We made a lot of mistakes at that time. We could have won one map, but we lost it. Now we fixed our problems. I think that's the biggest reason we won today."" The victory sets The MongolZ up for a rematch against SAW in the second upper bracket round of the group. The two teams faced each other on Wednesday in the Play-In stage, with the Portuguese outfit running out 2-1 winners. ""The last match, we were ahead on Anubis,"" Techno said. ""We just made a lot of mistakes. We made so many in this match. I think we will now figure it out, and I think we can win it. We didn't underestimate them, they're a good team."" It has been just two weeks since The MongolZ made history by entering the top 10 in the world rankings, but they don't plan on stopping here. As they prepare for Sunday's grudge match against SAW, the Mongolians have another goal in their sights: securing a spot at the LANXESS arena and playing in front of a massive crowd.

Astralis booked a spot in Group A's upper semi-finals at IEM Cologne thanks to a convincing 2-0 victory against 9z. The Danish team were made to work hard to win on Dust2, but they came out on top in the early exchanges on Inferno and never let up on the gas. IEM Cologne provides Astralis with the opportunity to show that they can dance with the best now that the hype accompanying Alexander ""br0"" Bro's arrival and Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz's transition to IGL has died down. The team come to the event in Germany after finishing top-four at YaLLa Compass and top-six at the BLAST Premier Spring Final before the summer break. ""We invested a lot of time and resources to get the train going, to climb the rankings and get to play all the tier-one events after the player break,"" Casper ""ruggah"" Due told HLTV after the win against 9z. ""This also meant that we lost the energy and the ability to refresh our playbook and go into details with things. ""The last half of the season, we wanted to do better, but I think that, at the end of the day, we just ran out of steam because we had to play everything to climb the rankings."" With Astralis currently inside the top 10, the plan is to to peak at the right time — and that means not just the upcoming Major in Shanghai but also the BLAST Fall Final in Copenhagen, an all-important stop for the Danish team. ""We have already picked our spots in the calendar where we want to, like, take a step back and do some things,"" ruggah said. ""Like, re-do a playbook, look at the trends and the meta so we are strong coming into the Major cycle. ""The BLAST Fall Final is one of the marks in the calendar we are looking forward to a lot. It's been a while since Astralis have been able to have fans cheering for us on home soil. So, hopefully, we get that one minimum win in the groups to go there. We are pretty hyped for that one."" In an interview with Dust2.dk, br0 said that ""it's time"" for Astralis to reach a final after a handful of quarter-final and semi-final finishes. Asked about his player's comments, ruggah set a more modest goal for Cologne: making it out of the groups. ""I think we showed in the first half of the season that we were competitors and people should respect us and expect us to go to the playoffs,"" he said. ""So that's the ambition we have internally. And we know that, once the playoffs start, anything can happen. ""Even if we start from the quarter-finals, I think we have the chance to compete against anyone. We're happy to get a win here in the beginning. We'll see how far it goes.""",11-8-2024 11:32,1723368720000
Vitality walk over FURIA; big plays get MOUZ past Falcons,https://www.hltv.org/news/39586/vitality-walk-over-furia-big-plays-get-mouz-past-falcons,"Two plays by torzsi and xertioN made sure that Falcons would not get back into the game late into the decider map. Vitality kicked off their IEM Cologne in stylish fashion, battering FURIA on Inferno (13-3) and Mirage (13-2) to seal a 2-0 win. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's men have earned themselves an upper bracket bout with FaZe, whilst FURIA head down to the lower bracket to take on Liquid. Vitality didn't have the most fruitful season over the first half of the year, making a few finals and semi-finals but failing to pick up a trophy. Before this match Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan emphasised how much Vitality were focusing on their IEM Cologne campaign compared to other events, stating that a Cologne trophy would ""heal"" the pain of their barren 2024 thus far, and that focus showed as his team rolled over FURIA. There were a few chances for FURIA to earn a better score on Inferno, they squandered some man-advantages, but overall Vitality's stars blew the Brazilians off the server with relative ease. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut was a menace with the AWP, flameZ was a monstrous anchor on Inferno, and Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi and William ""mezii"" Merriman provided immense impact on Mirage. On the A stream what started out as a one-sided trouncing of Falcons by MOUZ ended up being a close three-map affair. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and his men were running circles around MOUZ on Nuke, always one step ahead on rotations, getting easy entries and even winning the occasional clutch all the way to an 11-1 lead. Falcons put up a cosmetic comeback in the second half, but were kept to no more than six rounds before MOUZ put it to bed recovering from a 3vs5 situation. Vertigo was a much closer affair from the start, which was marked by Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer getting 13 kills in five rounds to kick Falcons into gear. He only got one more in the half and it looked like he and his teammates were losing steam, but they fought through and took it in the final round of regulation. Competition remained fierce on Ancient, where the two teams were once again divided by a slim margin going into the switch, but once MOUZ found their footing on the defense it looked like there was little Falcons could do to stop the map from slipping away. In the end, it was two big rounds that pushed it over the line. Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás downed four players and popped off as he got his team on match point, mere seconds before Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman delivered a quick ace to make it 13-9 and end it then and there. Up next for MOUZ is an upper bracket match against Complexity to secure a spot at the Lanxess Arena, while Falcons play Virtus.pro for survival in the group's lower bracket.",11-8-2024 16:32,1723386720000
"mezii: ""When ZywOo gets this ace at the start, you're like, 'It's going to be tough for them'""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39587/mezii-when-zywoo-gets-this-ace-at-the-start-youre-like-its-going-to-be-tough-for-them,"The British player praised his team's mentality after they breezed past FURIA in their opening group match. Vitality got off to a flying start at IEM Cologne 2024 as they made light work of FURIA in a 2-0 series that they were in control of from the get-go. The Brazilians were crushed in every department, with Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut setting the tone for a quick victory with a stunning ace in the opening round. ""When I see ZywOo just pop off with five kills, it's like, I know it's going to be a tough day for the other team,"" William ""mezii"" Merriman told HLTV after the match. After an upset-filled opening day, mezii was pleased that his team displayed the right mentality in their first match in Cologne. As Vitality chase their first trophy of 2024, he said that winning this event would ease some of the pain from their losses this year. ""It's one of the tournaments that every professional wants to win and it's one of the big ones,"" he said. ""So it's definitely one of our goals to do this."" A 2-0 victory in your first match of the tournament. It was kind of the perfect start, the dream start to the tournament. Did you expect it to be this easy? No, you can't ever expect it to be easy. I think, especially for us, we put a real focus on being able to start strongly in the tournament, in the first game, because in past tournaments we've kind of struggled with this, and I think today we just made sure that we give the energy that we need to give from the start. We've already seen a lot of the underdogs winning their matchups and we didn't want to be that team that's also going to lose, so we gave everything today. I'm happy with how we played today. Life gets a lot easier when ZywOo is having a good day. And that first round on Inferno was a sign that he was going to have a good day. Yeah, I mean, I was on the other bombsite, but when I see ZywOo just pop off with five kills, it's like, I know it's going to be a tough day for the other team. Even without this start, he's the best player in the world and when he gets this ace at the start, you're, like, 'It's going to be tough for them.' You didn't have the best of starts to the season. It was a little bit rough at the EWC and then, at the BLAST Fall Groups, you also struggled a little bit, especially in the game against GamerLegion. What was the mindset heading into the event? I think the same as always, just trusting the process and the preparation that we've done. We put in a lot of work after the player break, whether that's individually or as a team. And I think, even for me, I know I've shown some good games and good glimpses of what I can do. It's just about focusing more on that and kind of bringing the confidence and the energy to all these games. I can definitely do it. It's just about doing it more consistently. You had some deep runs during the previous season, but for some reason, you couldn't take the final step. This has led to some suggestions that maybe the team could switch some roles around to try to shake things up. Has this been discussed internally? Is this something that you're considering? Not really. For us, it's never been too much on these things in-game. We're a team that needs to make sure we're bringing this high energy to the games, and I think that's what we're trying to do. Even last season, when we made these deep runs, it was so close in a few of those finals where we could have gone all the way and taken the trophy, but sometimes it doesn't happen. That's the way CS goes, and sometimes you can't think too deeply about things. And, of course, there are always adjustments we make, but not exactly positional. I think it was just more about learning from our mistakes and learning from these games because that's the main thing. We definitely made a lot of new things and adjustments, which are helping us now, and I think practice and preparation have been going really well. That's the main thing. You're now going up against FaZe, a team that is going through a tough spell. What are your expectations heading into this match? They looked good in their first matchup, so that's always one thing. For us, it's just making sure that we can really focus… It's another challenge, it's a new game, and like I said, we can't focus too much on their struggles. I think we've also had struggles as well, so it's just about focusing on one game at a time. We know what FaZe can do, they've got the individuals, and they're a team that has won multiple tournaments. So for us, it's just focusing on FaZe. We know they can be strong, we have to just give all we can and perform the way we did in this opening game and the way we've been doing in practice. We've seen some favorites falter here in Cologne. G2 and Spirit dropped down to the lower bracket, and one of them is going out today. It seems like Cologne is going to be an open race. What do you think that means for your chances here at the tournament? To be honest, it's not something we focus too much on. If it's a lower-ranked team or a high-ranked team that we could be going up against next or whether it's in the playoffs… We've made mistakes in the past where we were kind of focusing too much on opponents or who we could be playing in two games' time. For us, it's just about focusing on one game at a time, and that's why I'm really happy today. We focused on our first challenge, got over that obstacle, and we can go into the next one against FaZe. Like I said, there are a lot of underdogs winning here. And maybe that's a mistake of the other teams where they're kind of underestimating, or maybe they're not fully ready for that first game. We just want to make sure that whoever we play, whether it's a Spirit, a FaZe, or a MOUZ, whoever it is, that we treat everyone the same way. As we've seen, anyone can beat anyone, and on the day, we just need to bring high energy. flameZ said in the pre-match interview that winning Cologne is the main goal. Do you agree with him? Do you think that if you manage to go all the way here, it will take away some of the pain from some of the losses that you've had this year? Cologne is a different beast. It's a completely different tournament than everything else. Of course, it feels bad when we lose these finals at the start of the season, and we felt we could have taken some of them. Of course, the goal is to win Cologne, it's one of the biggest tournaments, so if we can win this one, it does take away some of it, of course not everything. It's one of the tournaments that every professional wants to win and it's one of the big ones, so it's definitely one of our goals to do this.",11-8-2024 17:03,1723388580000
NAVI advance to the LANXESS with Astralis stomp,https://www.hltv.org/news/39588/navi-advance-to-the-lanxess-with-astralis-stomp,"iM and jL deliver in spades as Natus Vincere move into playoffs and extend their Mirage win streak to 11. Natus Vincere are the first team into IEM Cologne's playoffs after convincing wins over paiN and now Astralis (13-4, 13-7) in Group A. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's squad have dropped just 19 rounds in four maps as the No. 1 side ripped through IEM Cologne's group stage to secure a top-six berth, at least. A semi-final spot is now one series away, with Natus Vincere set to be heavy favorites against one of The MongolZ or SAW. NAVI began the season by winning the Esports World Cup but then had struggles at BLAST Groups, losing twice to the new Liquid roster, but have learned from their mistakes to enter the highest prestige non-Major event of the season in red hot form. It's a level of dominance NAVI never showed even during their Major win, where they famously lost more rounds than they won en route to the trophy. Here, that could not be more different: 73% round win rate, three players above a 1.40 rating, and straight into playoffs with a 4-0 record. ""You're playing better counter-strike now than when you won the Major,"" Jacob ""Pimp"" Winneche told Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius on the analyst desk after the match and jL was in full agreement. Clip: iM's Conn lurk works again Key to their new season form has been the level of Mihai ""iM"" Ivan, who had been under scrutiny ever since signing for NAVI despite the team's success. The Romanian spacetaker averaged a 1.01 rating for NAVI in 2023, and a 0.88 at the Major, but is up to a 1.17 in the last month and a team-high 1.51 over IEM Cologne so far. ""It feels amazing,"" iM told James ""BanKs"" Banks post-game. ""Everything worked for me, every play that I did. As the guy taking space if everything works it's hard for the opponents."" ""We did everything by the game plan, we spoke how we were going to play like usual and everything worked out."" The win also saw Natus Vincere extend their Mirage win streak to 11, a home map befitting a team that is ramping up at the perfect time. NAVI now move onto a seeding match to decide if they will begin playoffs from the quarter or semi finals, against the winner of The MongolZ versus SAW after upsets saw Spirit and G2 drop into the lower bracket. Astralis, meanwhile, join that lion's den, and will be disappointed with their performance against NAVI. Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and company barely made a dent and were blown out of the water by the combined firepower of iM, jL, and Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy. The 4-13 defeat on Ancient should be particularly concerning, given it was the map that helped put the new Astralis on the map last season. The team's individuals, too, will need to improve greatly if the side want to match last year's playoff run.",11-8-2024 18:43,1723394580000
SAW beat The MongolZ to secure shock Cologne playoff berth,https://www.hltv.org/news/39589/saw-beat-the-mongolz-to-secure-shock-cologne-playoff-berth,"The Mongolian squad drops down to the lower bracket to face the winner of paiN vs. 9z. SAW have defeated The MongolZ in the Group A upper bracket semi-final with a 2-1 scoreline (Ancient 13-16, Nuke 13-7, Anubis 13-10). The win means the Portuguese side, who shocked G2 in their opening match on Saturday, secured a quarter-final appearance at a minimum. This is the first time SAW will appear in a Big Event playoff in their history, and the same goes for the lengthy careers of Ricardo ""roman"" Oliveira and Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes. ""We are putting in so many hours, it's an incredible feeling. I feel like we deserve it, I have no words. It feels like a dream,"" said a happy roman in a post-match interview. ""When they started to win some rounds, it was super difficult, and Anubis CT is really hard,"" added MUTiRiS. ""It was a bit shaky, but we won, so it's amazing."" Their group-stage campaign isn't over yet, though, as they will face off against Natus Vincere for a semi-final spot. For The MongolZ, this is a rough loss in what was their best chance to make it to the LANXESS. They now drop down to the lower bracket to face the winner of paiN vs. 9z, but they will need to beat one of Spirit, G2, or Astralis to make it to the playoffs. The match began on Ancient, where both teams struggled on the CT side in regulation and needed overtime to get the job done. The MongolZ went from 10-4 up to 10-11 down before  Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch's resurgence late into the map proved vital for the Mongolian side. The 22-year-old continued to perform in OT, where a double-AWP setup on CT delivered his team the map. Clip: 910 comes alive with 4k to stop SAW win streak Nuke began with Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing's ace in the pistol round, which set the scene for an electric half of Counter-Strike full of clutches, with most of them going in favor of The MongolZ. The first half ended 7-5 in favor of the Portuguese side and they kept up the momentum on the defense, as they lost only two rounds with The MongolZ unable to get control of the economy. The Anubis decider was another heavily T-sided affair, with The MongolZ almost coming back from 3-10 down. SAW's individuals got them the three rounds required, however, as they eked out a 13-10 win to secure a shock playoff appearance at IEM Cologne.

Spirit's miserable IEM Cologne campaign ended by G2,https://www.hltv.org/news/39590/spirits-miserable-iem-cologne-campaign-ended-by-g2,"Defending champions G2 move on to a battle with Astralis in the lower bracket with a dominant victory. World No. 2 and IEM Katowice champions Spirit are the first team to be eliminated from IEM Cologne's Stage 2, after a torrid showing where nothing went right for Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov and company. Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets was speechless as he took on the exit interview with James ""BanKs"" Banks. ""I don't know where Team Spirit were. Not on the server."" It was the same body language and atmosphere that was apparent pre-game, as Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia delivered a damning assessment of day one without appearing hopeful for day two. When asked if Spirit gave up on map two against The MongolZ, he said ""probably yes."" The hangover from such a humbling defeat carried over to the G2 series, as Spirit's gameplan and system fell apart at the seams in the face of an aggressive and individualistic masterclass from Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski's men. G2, by contrast, recovered from their defeat at the hands of SAW to utterly dominate with 13-3 and 13-1 wins to beat Spirit for the second time this season. Despite such a convincing win, G2 — who won IEM Cologne in 2023 — are not out of the woods yet and must win two more times before they will see the LANXESS arena. First up is Astralis, before a potential lower bracket final over one of The MongolZ, paiN, or 9z. ""We had a thirty-forty minute talk after losing to SAW, saying what we needed to do today,"" Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač told the desk. ""All of us stepped up individually."" huNter- himself began Nuke with a 20-kill first half, including a 5-0 record in opening duels as he went on to post his highest-ever rating on Counter-Strike 2 at 2.12. Clip: huNter- wins a quick 1v2 after knifing m0NESY earlier in the round ""I'm really happy my confidence is coming back,"" he continued. ""Everyone can carry the game, but I need to focus more on myself individually, do my routines, and I think I will be good."" But it was a team effort that stunted Spirit, with a clear plan for aggressive and disruptive early rounds. G2 won five rounds on Nuke without a single death, and dominated in such dramatic fashion that they even completed a lobby crunch with five survivals. Clip: A hectic Mirage A Execute ends in a m0NESY clutch to keep G2 rolling It was more of the same on Mirage, as a disaffected and quiet Spirit slumped to another uncharacteristic defeat. Even donk struggled as the whole system came to a grinding halt with a 3-11 K-D in the first half of Mirage. zont1x, too, had a horror show as his nightmare from day one carried over into Spirit's second and final match. His match ratings read: 0.58, 0.69, 0.33, and 0.85 to leave him at 0.59, his worst-ever event with Spirit.

"Aleksib: ""My first time in LANXESS, which is a very, very nice feeling""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39591/aleksib-my-first-time-in-lanxess-which-is-a-very-very-nice-feeling,"NAVI have not taken a day off since BLAST Fall groups, and their hard work is paying off in the server. Natus Vincere and Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen have justified their standing as the number one team in the world with a dominant start to IEM Cologne. First, paiN were demolished and now Astralis have suffered the same fate at the hands of Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy and Aleksib's well-oiled machine. NAVI's proud captain has never made it to playoffs in Cologne before, and with Spirit eliminated he will now enter the LANXESS arena as favorite to lift the trophy. The Finn swung by HLTV's microphone to talk about what this arena means to him, the grind after losing to Liquid at BLAST, and the ""fresh motivation and hunger"" fuelling NAVI's uptick in form. A 2-0 victory against Astralis, the team that knocked you out last year. It must feel pretty good to get revenge against them and also to secure a spot in the playoffs. Yeah, it feels super amazing, considering we were playing exactly in the same seats, facing each other. They beat us on the decider that day, and for us, it was a disaster not to make it to the playoffs. And throughout my career, I had actually made the playoffs in Cologne only once, and it was during COVID, so I didn't get to play on the stage. So it's going to be my first time, which is a very, very nice feeling. You were coming off a three-game losing streak on Ancient, but here you just dominated them on the map. What changed? To be honest, we just played Spirit. I mean, we had another loss there, but the thing is that Spirit was the team that kind of cracked us on this map. And we were doing pretty well on the map, actually, and it's one of our strengths in the map pool, so we didn't mind any opponent picking it. We've been improving on it week by week, and now we finally managed to play a solid CT side. I believe I checked and in the last 10 CT pistols, we only won one time. That didn't help us, those sloppy CT starts. Today was different. We've been improving, and that's the most important thing. You are one of the best teams on Mirage, if not the best. Are you happy with your performance on this map, even though you lost both pistols? I am super happy, and that makes me even more confident on the map. We lost both pistols against a solid team and it still felt like we were in control the whole game. We just seem to be feeling the map, every individual feels confident, and It's a strong suit of ours. During the BLAST Fall Groups, jL said that said that the focus was on Cologne, on fixing your mistakes and getting the team ready for this event. What lessons did you did you learn from your performances there? Liquid put us to the test, so we got a lot of maps played during the BLAST Groups. And to be honest, we've not taken a day off since and we've just been grinding. Yes, the focus is on Cologne, and we reviewed all the games we played in Copenhagen. To me, it's very important that, once we do the review, we play the next game and I can see that we actually improved. That's a nice feeling. And I think B1ad3 is also proud of us. I guess one of the biggest questions about NAVI is how reliant you guys are on Mirage and Nuke. Was it important for you to get tested on other maps like Inferno and Anubis in Copenhagen? And what steps are you taking to make sure that you are more consistent on other maps? As I said, reviewing, coming up with something new and always trying to improve. And the thing for us is we know what we like and what we don't like. Ancient was strong for us until we played Spirit two times, and they managed to beat us both times. Nuke was super weak for us before we finally turned it around, and now it's a strong suit, so for us it's just adapting, doing our thing and believing. And I think that when the group is fired up like this, I don't mind the map because we can play solid CS. During the Major run, all the praise was going to jL, even though your victory in the final probably wouldn't have happened if b1t didn't have that amazing performance in the final map. But now, since the player break, it seems like b1t has taken his game to a whole new level. He's probably one of the best players in the game. What changed for him? I don't think too much has changed in terms of how we approach the game. But I just feel that he also relies on how we take map control, how we are giving information, how he is giving information. I've seen his growth this past year and I think he's communicating well in English and in really important moments. Sometimes he might communicate in Ukrainian if he's in a clutch situation or something like that, but to me, it just feels that he has gotten more comfortable with us and also the way I am calling mid-games. Overall, when the actual system was working and we finally started to adapt a lot of these details that B1ad3 has been introducing, b1t started to play a lot better. B1ad3 said yesterday that he wants w0nderful to learn how to call. How important would it be for you and for the team to have the AWPer being able to call and dictate the pace during rounds? We can play many different styles and I'm open to anything. I always want Ihor to be super comfortable when it comes down to how he wants to approach. And when he's fired up, he's fully dictating a lot of games for us, and it's also really good that he can play into the system as well. He's a really versatile player, and I'll do anything for him to have a smile next to me. Before Cologne started, everyone thought that this was the group of death. You had Spirit, you had G2, two teams that are now in the lower bracket and one of them is going home today. How does that make you feel about your chances of finishing at the top of the group and making it to the semi-finals? Winning this game was super important because of obvious reasons. You're going to face G2 or Spirit if you lose and you don't really want to go there because I mean, obviously securing a playoff spot early is important. And we made it happen. Now we're waiting for the winner of that game SAW vs The MongolZ and It's just going to be another game. Some people might say we kind of avoided those two strong teams, but at the same time, we beat who was in front of us and we know that we had a lot of focus on this tournament. So just making the quarter-finals isn't a goal of ours. We want to lift another trophy or at least make the finals. We're keeping it serious, one game at a time, and we'll see how it goes. Some people described your Major win as a fluke, and some said that winning the EWC wasn't worth much because it was the first tournament out of the player break. How important would it be for you guys to win Cologne here? And do you think that would silence all the doubters? Obviously, our performances after the Major didn't go the way we had hoped. We had a lot of deep discussions afterward. And the way we turned up at the start of this season, with fresh motivation and the overall hunger of the players… After that, we saw that we can't play CS if not everyone is on the same page, basically. Now we've kind of turned the page and we're playing some solid CS. People can have doubts or say whatever they feel like, but at the end of the day, we've been pretty consistent this year, especially during the second season now. As I said, one game at a time now, and anything can happen in the playoffs. And I guess your goal is to go all the way in Cologne, right? Yes, of course.",11-8-2024 20:57,1723402620000
paiN eliminate 9z from IEM Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39593/pain-eliminate-9z-from-iem-cologne,"The Brazilians move on to play The MongolZ in the lower-bracket semi-final. paiN have defeated 9z in a three-map series (Anubis 11-13, Dust2 13-8, Nuke 13-9) to eliminate them from IEM Cologne. paiN's next test will come against The MongolZ in the lower-bracket semi-final, with the Brazilians requiring two straight wins to secure an unlikely playoff spot due to G2 and Astralis standing on the other side of their bracket. ""We are so happy we bounced back from Anubis. We had total control on Nuke, but then they started doing some quick rounds, but the eco round was incredible,"" Lucas ""lux"" Meneghini said in a post-match interview. ""We just need to face FURIA now because we played against all the SA teams. It's kind of funny, we went to Cologne, and we just played regional teams,"" he added. For 9z, this is a disappointing end to the tournament. The South American team was looking to build on its fantastic performance at IEM Dallas earlier in the year and began their Cologne campaign with two dominant wins against 3DMAX and MIBR in the play-in stage. Their group-stage performance left much to be desired, however, as they followed up an opening loss to Astralis with a defeat to paiN, who are ranked 12 places below them in the world rankings. Their CT sides on Dust2 and Nuke were the biggest reason for their loss, as they could only post a combined five rounds on the two defensive halves. ""On CT we were really bad, our calls and reads just weren't good. We came back on the T sides, but it wasn't enough to win the game,"" said in-game-leader Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez. The first map of the series, Anubis, was decided by clutches. paiN were ahead early on after two 1v1s by João ""snow"" Vinicius on the CT side, but 9z were able to answer. The clutches started going their way, and their fifth of the map, courtesy of Nicolás ""buda"" Kramer, was the one to get them to 13. Clip: paiN win with MP9s to reach match point paiN began Dust2 well as they dominated the early game, but Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez warmed up his AWP to give his team five at the switch. Once paiN were on the T-side, however, they switched into a higher gear and blew 9z out of the water with a 13-8 victory. After two back-and-forth maps, the same was expected for Nuke, but it wasn't what we got. paiN won the pistol and ran away with a 10-2 offensive half, and while 9z made the scoreline respectable in the end, paiN won a round with MP9s to turn the tide and stay alive in Cologne.",11-8-2024 22:54,1723409640000
IEM Cologne groups day 2 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39585/iem-cologne-groups-day-2-as-it-happened,"On win against 9z in post-match interview with sjokz: ""We are so happy we bounced back from Anubis. On Nuke we had total control, but then they started doing some quick rounds, but the eco round was incredible."" On their opponents: ""We just need to face FURIA now, because we played against all the SA teams now. It's kind of funny, we went to Cologne, and we just played regional teams.** On snow: ""It's great I have an in-ear, or else I would be deaf. It's incredible to have him on the team."" It got a bit scary at the end, but paiN's 10 rounds on the offense were enough for them to stay alive in Cologne. They move on to face The MongolZ, while 9z suffer a last-place elimination in the group stage. 9z 8-12  paiN It was a 5v3 as well. 9z 5-11  paiN Four kills by Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt on the upper site. That has to be the final nail in the 9z coffin. 9z 3-10  paiN A road long to recovery is ahead of them, but 9z just completed the first step. Let's see if they can make this competitive at least. 9z 1-7  paiN 9z 0-7  paiN This is a rough start to the decider for 9z, who are yet to post a round. They came closest in Nicolás ""buda"" Kramer's 1v2 clutch attempt, but João ""snow"" Vinicius stopped his attempt with 5hp. 9z 0-4  paiN 9z 0-1  paiN 9z 8-13  paiN The teams played the map twice this year already, with 9z coming out on top both times, but paiN got the job done when it mattered most. Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt's performance can't be understated, as he put his team on his back and got them over the line. Next up is Nuke, where 9z have lost just six rounds in their matches against 3DMAX and MIBR at the IEM Cologne Play-In. 9z 8-12  paiN 9z 7-7  paiN 9z have equalized the score after receiving a gift from Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk, who was unable to kill Nicolás ""buda"" Kramer with his back turned. 9z 3-6  paiN Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez with some much needed impact with the AWP, and 9z reduce the deficit to three. Their next test is winning consecutive rounds, something they haven't done so far. 9z 1-5  paiN No clutches on this map yet, as paiN are simply to dominant for that to happen. Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt is leading the way for his team with 11 kills, which includes a spicy spraydown. 9z 0-4  paiN Three kills in four rounds for 9z. G2 12-1  Spirit 9z 13-11  paiN The fifth clutch of the map for 9z, this one courtesy of Nicolás ""buda"" Kramer, is the one to get them over the line and secure them their opponent's pick. Next up is Dust2. G2 11-1  Spirit The firepower on G2 is out of this world, and Spirit have no answer. Even Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets, from his favorite spot of Connector, is getting nothing done. Spirit are starting down the barrel of a last-placed exit. 9z 11-11  paiN An entry and a closing noscope for Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez, and 9z have equalized the score at 11. 9z 9-11  paiN paiN overcooked the pooch in a 2v2 and let 9z back into the game, with the Brazilian's money non existent for the next round. G2 6-1  Spirit What a classic Mirage round here, an A execute with three key multi-kills. First, Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač jumping to Stairs, then Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov's flying MP9, and a Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov clutch to close. Who would get rid of this map? G2 4-1  Spirit How Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia needed that: He's had a terrible time in Cologne so far, but grabs a key multi-frag from the Window as G2 tried to go up Connector. 9z 5-7  paiN He has been quiet in the fragging department, but João ""snow"" Vinicius clutched another 1v1 by snow to help paiN secure the half. Lucas ""nqz"" Soares deserves praise too, with the AWPer sitting on 14 kills at the switch. The Kovacs are in town, boys. Spirit didn't even stand a chance. That's Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač's best ever map on CS2 and it's come at a crucial time. What a game from Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač, as Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets are kept in the back. What is up with Spirit in Cologne? There's none of the flair and teamplay we're so used to seeing. 9z 1-3  paiN G2 12-3  Spirit We hyped up a Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov-Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets clash but Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač has ruined that, first by getting 20 kills in a half and now with an accidental stab in the back. He wants all the headlines for himself. G2 9-3  Spirit This is absurd from Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač and G2. They've won five rounds without a single death. G2 6-1  Spirit Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia had a nightmare yesterday, gave a less-than-convincing interview pre-game, and is struggling today too. He's 0-3 in openers, 0-7 overall, and has just 10 ADR. Two timeouts used by Sergey ""hally"" Shavaev already after G2 win a lobby crunch with zero deaths. G2 4-1  Spirit G2's prep has been clear so far, with openers being found time and time again. Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač is having a field day from Door and Mini, trading Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač outside and dominating the Upper bombsite to hit 131 ADR so far. Few could have predicted one of these teams in the LANXESS, but the Portuguese side have just about done it. Despite being 10-3 up at one point they needed to work for it, but The MongolZ eventually ran out of steam. Both G2 and Spirit suffered shocking defeats on opening day. Only one of can now survive. SAW 12-10  The MongolZ A round that can only be described as utter chaos. SAW are just one round away from the LANXESS. G2, remember, destroyed Spirit on Mirage and Nuke at Esports World Cup. Will we see the same map pool? Cagey as ever from Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia, with a pretty negative tone if we're honest. Not what you want to see if you're a Spirit fan. On the loss to The MongolZ: ""We were tilted after we lost Ancient, we couldn't handle the problems we had. Every time we played defaults we lost another kill. It was not our day."" On if they gave up mentally: ""Probably yes."" ""We said, if you want to keep playing here in Cologne you need to wake up. Inside the game it's not a problem. We just need to wake up."" SAW 11-9  The MongolZ SAW 11-6  The MongolZ SAW faltered against the second-round forcebuy, but have now returned to winning ways after a four-round streak by The MongolZ. Their money is far from strong, though. SAW 9-3  The MongolZ This has been a bloodbath so far. SAW are hitting every timing and headshot needed to break through the defenses, and are now just four rounds away from the LANXESS. ""100%,"" agrees Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius on the desk. Hard to argue with that. SAW 5-1  The MongolZ SAW have started well on the Anubis offense, The MongolZ are getting outmaneuvered pretty much every round. ""Everything worked for me, every play that I did. As the guy taking space if everything works it's hard for the opponents,"" Mihai ""iM"" Ivan told James ""BanKs"" Banks. ""We did everything by the game plan, we spoke how we were going to play like usual and everything worked out."" Natus Vincere 10-6  Astralis The captain is delivering in frags, but not in getting his team activated. None of the four Astralis riflers have looked comfortable this series. Natus Vincere 8-4  Astralis The aggressive lurks from Mihai ""iM"" Ivan just keep working. This is the level he showed on Mirage when he knocked Martin ""stavn"" Lund and Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard out of the Paris Major in 2023 as a GamerLegion player. Clip: iM's Conn lurk works again SAW 13-7  The MongolZ The MongolZ posted just two rounds on their offense as their consecutive forcebuy failed to work out. That left them in an economic hole they were unable to get out of, and SAW made the most of that to sail to a 13-7 victory. We're off to the decider of Anubis, a map that SAW picked in their clash in the play-in. Natus Vincere 1-2  Astralis NAVI haven't lost Mirage since they played HEROIC on it at IEM Dallas in May, and are 19-6 on the map this year. Pistol goes Astralis way as they look to repeat the feats of their longtime rival. SAW 7-5  The MongolZ Clutches by Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold and Sodbayar ""Techno"" Munkhbold kept the Mongolian side close, but their economy ran out toward the end of the half and allowed SAW to take a two-round lead into the CT side. SAW 5-4  The MongolZ They haven't been at their best on Nuke, but The MongolZ are hanging on for dear life on the CT side. Their economy has been at breaking point since the start of the half. Astralis were out of steam at the end of last season, but they didn't even put any coal into the engine on Ancient. Utter domination from Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan. Natus Vincere 9-4  Astralis It's been convincing for NAVI, on a map that us usually so strong for Astralis. NAVI lost three in a row on Ancient before this, remember. SAW 1-0  The MongolZ Astralis 3-4  Natus Vincere The Group A upper-bracket match between Astralis and Natus Vincere, with a playoff spot on the line, has kicked off on The Danish squad's Ancient pick. The series will move to Mirage and Dust2 is in the chamber in case a decider is necessary to break a tie after the first two maps. After both teams struggled on the CT side in regulation, The MongolZ's defensive clean sweep in OT was enough to ensure victory. Both teams played relatively up-tempo offenses, both teams got clutch plays out of their star players, but The MongolZ had a little more down the stretch. Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch's resurgence late into the map was utterly vital for the Mongolian side when they went from 10-4 up to 10-11 down, he hauled them out of a tough spot in regulation and continued to perform in OT. SAW 12-15  The MongolZ Defensive halves were a struggle for both teams in regulation, so The MongolZ might have just won themselves the map with such a clean half in OT. SAW 11-12  The MongolZ This game is getting VERY tense. SAW 10-11  The MongolZ SAW strung six in a row and seemed poised to complete the comeback win, but Hao ""TH"" Tang came up trumps on the B site with his AWP. SAW 9-10  The MongolZ Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto has come alive at the right time for SAW, finding multi-kill after multi-kill to help the Portuguese side's up-tempo T side reel in their Mongolian counterparts. MOUZ 13-9  Falcons MOUZ strung six straight rounds of the CT side of Ancient — including a quad-kill by Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás to hit map point and an ace by Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman to end it — to clip Falcons' wings, securing the series in three maps to keep their run going in the group B upper bracket. SAW 4-10  The MongolZ Starting to look rough for SAW. They didn't quite fully clear out the A site in a 3v5, and in the confused melee that occured they were mowed down trying to plant the bomb. SAW 4-8  The MongolZ Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren called a beautiful T side, conditioning the B site with a variety of attacks before hitting A when it was understaffed. Even when it looked like he had overcooked the mid-round, going from Middle all the way through spawn to B to flank the A bombsite, The MongolZ somehow made it work. MOUZ 7-6  Falcons Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo won a 1vs2 to keep MOUZ ahead at halftime as he and his teammates recovered from a 1-5 start with six rounds in a row to switch over to the CT side with a two-round lead. SAW 3-4  The MongolZ Remember when I said SAW were in control? I lied. The MongolZ have started rinsing and repeating hits towards B and SAW can't hold the site, even when they stack it with four players. SAW 3-1  The MongolZ Sodbayar ""Techno"" Munkhbold might have kicked this game off with a tasty multi-kill, but SAW answered back with a force-buy and have now taken control of the half. MOUZ 1-4  Falcons Falcons got off to a 4-0 start on the CT side of Ancient, the decider map, and although Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García brought a 3vs5 back to a 3vs3, they couldn't stop MOUZ from getting on the board int he fifth round. MOUZ 11-13  Falcons Falcons didn't let up on the attack and got one over on MOUZ in the very last round of regulation, leaving behind the bad taste left from Nuke as the slate has been wiped clean and both teams head to Ancient for what will be the deciding map in the series. Vitality barely had to break a sweat in that series. FURIA had a few opportunities to bag some more rounds on Inferno, they squandered a number of man-advantages, but Mirage was entirely one-way traffic. Vitality's stars were in red-hot form, even William ""mezii"" Merriman did some good work early doors on Mirage. Not much to analyse about that one, Vitality were on a completely different level to FURIA. The Brazilians will need to just dust themselves off and move on. Vitality 9-2  FURIA Vitality 6-1  FURIA William ""mezii"" Merriman has been on a heater with the opening kills, and Vitality as a team have just outclassed FURIA. The Brazilians bite on every piece of bait dangled in front of them, and Vitality capitalize every time. MOUZ 7-5  Falcons An early fragging spurt by in-game leader Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer put Falcons in the lead on the CT side of Vertigo, but MOUZ ground their way back into it through the half and carry a two round lead at the switch. The captain, who had 13 kills in five rounds, only managed one more by half-time. MOUZ 1-4  Falcons Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer is leading the charge to try and defibrillate Falcons after their Nuke fiasco with a 13-1 scoreline after the first five rounds. MOUZ 1-2  Falcons Falcons won the first pistol round on Vertigo to go up 2-0 on the CT side, but couldn't convert against MOUZ's first buy as a big flank and clutch by Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás put his team on the board. Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan's improvement as an anchor in recent months has been remarkable, and this performance, which was mostly produced on the CT side, is proof. Vitality 13-3  FURIA FURIA will be wanting to move on from that map quickly. The Brazilian side actually generated a fair few 5v4 advantages but struggled to convert, particularly in the face of Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's AWP towards A and Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan's magnificent holds towards B. That was FURIA's pick, so Vitality are firmly in the driver's seat. MOUZ 13-6  Falcons Mathieu ""Maniac"" Quiquerez walked through one of the most beautiful plays of the clash between MOUZ and Falcons on Nuke after the map's conclusion. It was a play by Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás, piling the pain on a struggling Falcons, by clutching a 1vs2 situation with his team already up 10-1 on the CT side. MOUZ 13-6  Falcons Falcons put up a cosmetic comeback by winning five straight rounds on the CT side while up against map point after an abysmal 1-11 half, but threw a 5vs3 to let the round slip between their fingers. Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen's men will need a massive mental reset after losing their map pick in such one-sided fashion as the series now heads to MOUZ's Vertigo pick. MOUZ 12-3  Falcons MOUZ gave Falcons another round to tally to a map that's all but over as Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás unwarrantedly killed Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman in a 2vs3 afterplant clutch, warranting the AWPer to apologize: ""Sorry, Dori."" Vitality 9-3  FURIA Vitality 7-3  FURIA Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire has suffered quite a few avoidable deaths in this game, but fortunately his team are saving his blushes. Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan does so this time with a beautiful solo hold of the B site. Vitality 6-3  FURIA FURIA's success has been largely individualistic and based on faster-paced CS, catching Vitality off guard or in transition. Quite a few short tech pauses in this map by the way, which is breaking up the flow of the game. MOUZ 9-1  Falcons Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García, who had come back to life in the IEM Cologne Play-in after failing to maintain the level that made him the sixth best player of 2023 in the first half of the year, is again at the bottom of the scoreboard and struggling with a 0-10 start as MOUZ are smashing Falcons on Nuke. Vitality 5-1  FURIA A rough map for FURIA thus far, although after the calamity of losing a near-unlosable round to time, they did crack open the B bombsite to bag their first T round. MOUZ 5-0  Falcons MOUZ have gotten ahead in a match pitting one of the youngest teams against one of the oldest, as an average of eight years separates the two. As of now, MOUZ's youngsters have the one up with a 5-0 lead on the CT side of Falcons' Nuke pick. Nuke will be followed by Vertigo, with Ancient left over in the veto in case a decider is necessary. Vitality 2-0  FURIA Well, that's a way to kick off your IEM Cologne campaign. Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan spoke on stream with Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere ahead of his team's upcoming game against FURIA, and he emphasised how important Cologne was for Vitality. On favorites losing on day one: It gives us a little slap in the face, because we are aware it is not a guaranteed win. I think with how the year has been for us, we have seen that any team can beat any team and there is no guarantee you can win any game easily in CS2. On Vitality's season so far: It doesn't feel like we had a really bad season, because we still hit some finals and some semis, but we want to win a trophy. This trophy specifically could heal a lot of the time we didn't pick up a trophy, and it's the biggest focus up until the Major. We really want to pick this trophy up because for everyone it will be very beneficial. If you look back you don't care that you didn't win Pro League or Dallas, you'd be really happy with this trophy. It's only day two of the IEM Cologne main event but already teams will either have their hearts broken or dreams realised. That's because later today a raft of elimination and progression games will be played out, which will guarantee an underdog a playoff spot and a favourite an early exit. Either Spirit or G2 will be forced to head home early, two of the titans of the current landscape. One of either The MongolZ or SAW will ensure a quarter-final spot and their best return at such a prestigious event. Before all that we get to see MOUZ and Vitality, two of the top contenders for the trophy, kick off their campaigns against Falcons and FURIA respectively.",11-8-2024 23:00,1723410000000
Virtus.pro's new season slump continues with Cologne exit,https://www.hltv.org/news/39597/virtuspros-new-season-slump-continues-with-cologne-exit,"Jame and electroNic's team have lost five matches in a row as the team toils with merging the duo's styles. Virtus.pro's losing streak has been extended by Falcons to five, condemning the Russian squad to a 13-16th placed exit from IEM Cologne. Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali's squad ended last season with a top-four finish at BLAST London and began this one with the same result at Esports World Cup, but have endured a torrid run since that semi-final with losses to G2, Liquid, BIG, Complexity and now Falcons. Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov's signing to Virtus.pro aroused significant fanfare, slotting in for Nikolay ""mir"" Bityukov in terms of positions perfectly, but as the 2021 Stockholm Major winner bedded into his new team the clash of styles between himself and Jame have upset the boat. ""When he joined, we realized we couldn't play our system anymore, so we had to either combine our systems or do as he wants because he has a strong voice,"" Jame said last month. That power struggle is ongoing, and the future is murky for the team based on the results. electroNic mustered few words for his exit interview, but his body language told the true story. That divide has left Virtus.pro in limbo: Losing what made them unique, yet lacking the firepower and synergy to compete as a five more in keeping with the European international meta. The transfer also occurred at the worst possible time for VP. Their home map, Overpass, was removed for Dust2, and the team has struggled on the latest addition to the map pool with four losses in their last five games. Clip: dupreeh finds both kills in a 1v2 with time running out on the bomb None are more damning than their latest, a 13-8 loss to Falcons where they won both pistols but were thoroughly outclassed in the gun rounds. With a different decider, there might have been plenty of positives for VP. They started the series with a 9-3 T side on Vertigo (which has a 68.7% T side win rate after three maps in Cologne), exploiting Emil ""Magisk"" Reif and Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen on B with perfect set pieces. On Mirage, they showed a strong mentality to recover from 8-4 down and go 9-0 in the second half to secure a decider. But that would be missing the forest for the trees. That Virtus.pro's 9-3 T half on Vertigo came from set pieces on B tells the true story, of a team that has lost faith in its defaults and is forcibly changing its style. The Mirage comeback was impressive, but they had a helping hand from Falcons' persistent force buys to do so. Clip: Snappi punishes a Jame overpeek with a clean 1v2 The team are now at a crossroads, with early elimination from two events in a row in disappointing fashion. Jame spoke of ""options"" in the break — perhaps now they will be exercised. Falcons, now, can take confidence from their performance into what will surely be a tougher test of the team's mettle against the loser of Vitality against FaZe. In-game leader Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer blamed his own performances for some of the team's results earlier in the year, but ended up second top of the scoreboard after some confidence-boosting eco fragging on his trademark SMGs and a key 1v2 clutch on Vertigo to keep the comeback rolling. Their dominance in the gun rounds on Dust2 was also telling of an improved if not free-flowing team, as Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García went 5-0 in opening duels and dupreeh took over proceedings with a 1v2 clutch of his own in the first half and some key multi-frags down the stretch. Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković dominated Mirage despite the loss with a 1.73 rating, and Magisk was crucial to Vertigo's comeback: All five players had their moments, and will need to again for Falcons' run to continue.",12-8-2024 17:22,1723476120000
Liquid brawl past FURIA in Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39596/liquid-brawl-past-furia-in-cologne,"A brawly rematch from the play-in stage went the way of Twistzz's team again as the Brazilians have been eliminated in last place of groups. Liquid have survived their first elimination match at IEM Cologne with 2-0 win over FURIA, sending the Brazilians home in last place of the group stage. It was a rematch from their earlier encounter in the play-in, which also went Liquid's way. This time around, they switched their ill-fated Anubis pick for Dust2, and found much more success on it despite it being only their second time playing the map. They looked in control throughout the Terrorist side, with the exception of one blunder where they threw away a round to time, but then took a long time to switch online as CT up against a red-hot Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros. Liquid's former teammate racked up 14 kills in five rounds to get the Brazilians within two rounds from victory. That was when Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis stepped up with a crucial triple while edging a smoke in defense of B, and the pace of the game immediately switched after that. The map descended into chaos as Liquid kicked into a new gear, with Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak aggressing all around the map and soon his whole team following suit. The Pole's restlessness was his undoing when FURIA punished him in the final round of regulation, but the Liquid squad was undeterred and kept pushing areas once in OT to lock down the first map. ""Holy shit, we're back in the fucking Grand Slam days,"" Keith ""NAF"" Markovic was heard exclaiming in a voice replay after one such round went their way. Clip: Liquid brawl in OT as Dust2 descends into chaos In a post-game interview, NAF also explained this change in pace came down to a timeout at 8-11 in which coach Torbjørn ""mithR"" Nyborg reminded the team not to play ""like a bunch of pussies."" It appeared as if FURIA had run out of steam once the series reached Nuke. Despite winning both pistol rounds, the Brazilians only came away with four rounds as Liquid dominated the map. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's team took over the game in round three as CT with a curious halfbuy featuring some MP9s, as their lobby crunch gave way to a 1v2 clutch from the Canadian himself. Liquid continued to give FURIA no respect all around the map and the Brazilians struggled to deal with the aggression, and they left Liquid's rampage unanswered for the remaining 10 rounds. By then it was almost all over, and Liquid didn't waste much time closing it out once on T. Clip: Liquid opt for a curious halfbuy to kick off a 10-round run on Nuke",12-8-2024 16:18,1723472280000
"huNter-: ""We were not ourselves against SAW""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39592/hunter-we-were-not-ourselves-against-saw,"The Bosnian player praised his team for immediately bouncing back after a shock defeat to SAW on Saturday. G2 live to fight another day in IEM Cologne's group stage as they brushed aside Spirit in a do-or-die elimination match. It was a much-improved performance from Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski's troops after Saturday's woeful showing against SAW in the opening round. Speaking to HLTV after the match, Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, who put in a 1.78 series rating against Spirit, said that Saturday was just an off-day for his team and that everyone quickly shook it off. ""The mood was not good for like 30 or 40 minutes,"" he said, ""but as soon as we got to the hotel and started talking about what was bad, what we could do better for the next day, it immediately changed and became positive."" Next up is a clash against Astralis, a team he hasn't faced since last year's Cologne semi-finals. huNter- is not taking anything for granted, but he sent out a warning after the win against Spirit: ""Confidence immediately came back."" A quick 2-0 victory against Spirit. You played at the level that people expect you to. Was it the sort of response that the team needed to give after what happened yesterday? Yeah, I mean, we had, not a big talk, but a 30, 40-minute talk yesterday after we played against SAW. We were not ourselves yesterday and were not as focused as today. I'm really happy that we bounced back and managed to play like we did today against Spirit. It just feels good. The job is not done. We need to win two more games to reach the playoffs. This is your second win in a row against Spirit. You really seem to have their number. Yeah. I mean, I think Spirit is not the Spirit they were last season. I think they are not doing what people expect them to do and what they themselves expect to do. They are not playing that well. That's the reason they lost to The MongolZ yesterday and lost to us as they did today. But we played really well, and the way we played today is how everybody expects us to play. And that's what we really want, players and coach. What happened yesterday against SAW? I spoke with roman after the match and he said that he felt you were a little bit shaky, that maybe you came in a little bit cold. Did you feel that way, that things just weren't clicking and it was just an off day for you? I think we were a bit cold and we didn't do what we should do individually. I think we were missing a lot of free shots and free frags and that was the main reason, I think, why we lost. But of course, they were tactically better than us. I think they prepared really, really well for us, especially on Inferno, on their T side. On Nuke, we didn't have a chance either. So, yeah, I think they played really well. They were really well prepared. We didn't play well individually. We were tactically not good either in that game. Yeah, that's the reason we lost. What was the mood like after such a match, where you lose to an underdog? Especially with you being one of the favorites for the trophy and the defending champions? What conclusions did you come to after the match? The mood was not good for like 30 or 40 minutes, but as soon as we got to the hotel and started talking about what was bad, what we could do better for the next day, it immediately changed and became positive because we were not out of the event and we were still here. So we still had a chance to qualify. It doesn't matter. It was like a good warning for us, I would say. I'm really happy with the way we bounced back today. It was like a wake-up call. Yeah, kind of a wake-up call. You are now going to face Astralis. Do you know how long it has been since you faced them? I don't know. Cologne last year. What expectations do you have for this match? Since last year we've changed two players, even three, when nexa came after as well. They changed a lot of players in the team. I think they have a really good team but haven't shown it yet, results-wise. They were not playing well, I would say. They were playing okay but not like they want to play, I would say. I think it will be a very tough game for both teams. It will not be easy, but if we play the way we did today, and if we come into the game the way we did today, I think we shouldn't be scared of anything. You have no more margin for error in the loser's bracket. Looking at the rest of the teams in your group, do you expect to make it into the playoffs? I'm always the guy who is going step by step. I don't even know who we might get if we beat Astralis, so the next focus and the only focus for me in Cologne is Astralis right now. We need to focus on them only and then we'll see what comes after. What goals did you set heading into this event? And has your confidence been affected in any way by what happened yesterday? Not really, especially after we convincingly beat Spirit, a team that is top two in the world. Confidence came back immediately, and, as I said, I'm happy with the way we bounced back. Goals for Cologne… I mean, everybody that comes to Cologne, there is no, like, thinking too much about goals. You want to do your best, you want to win every game, and you want to go all the way. Of course, Cologne is one of the best events, maybe even the best event of all, so you just want to give your best. Is this a fresh start for G2 in this tournament? Yeah, I think so. We'll see.",12-8-2024 09:49,1723448940000
MOUZ lock in Cologne playoff berth,https://www.hltv.org/news/39599/mouz-lock-in-cologne-playoff-berth,"The German organization will make its second LANXESS Arena appearance. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and company have earned their organization an appearance in front of its home crowd following a 2-0 victory over Complexity in the Group B upper bracket semi-final. The group stage aficionados have yet to lift a trophy in front of a large arena audience, but are among the favorites in the playoffs and will have a chance to dispel that narrative in the LANXESS. Complexity, meanwhile, find themselves cast down to the lower bracket and have a match against a red-hot Liquid ahead to avoid early elimination. The American team has had a rough time matching up against MOUZ and came into the series with a 4-10 map record and a five-series loss streak, and that record has been made worse following MOUZ's wins on Vertigo (13-9) and Nuke (13-11). Holes in Complexity's game continued to show in the series, particularly in their overreliance on fragging from Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski and repeated squandered advantages. Clip: MOUZ recover crucial round on Nuke after COL don't cover Decon The 27-year-old started the series on fire by punishing Ludvig ""Brollan"" Brolin at A Ramp, posting a 7-1 K-D to grant Complexity a 5-0 lead. Once that stopped working, however, Complexity fell completely flat: Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás' AWP and multi-kills from siuhy and Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo powered the European combine to an 11-round streak, and Complexity's best efforts to recover in the second half came too little, too late. EliGE went on a 4-14 run after his hot start, with Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou and Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery unable to make the difference. The latter rifler did well to deny Ramp attacks at the start of Nuke to grant Complexity a 6-2 lead, but an Upper rush from MOUZ stemmed the bleed for an even score at the break. Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman then punished a sloppy anti-eco to rob an early round in the second half, but Complexity repeatedly exploited Door to gain the lead. Back-to-back sloppy late rounds stopped them from converting that into a victory, however, with MOUZ instead converting, 13-11, to maintain their unbeaten record over JT's side on the map and lock in an arena berth.",12-8-2024 19:35,1723484100000
IEM Cologne groups day 1 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39576/iem-cologne-groups-day-1-as-it-happened,"Natus Vincere 13-4  paiN Natus Vincere have locked down their pick of Mirage with a 13-4 scoreline, a replica of their run on paiN's map pick of Anubis earlier in the series. The international side will now be preparing for an upper-bracket semi-final versus Astralis, while paiN will be fighting for their tournament lives versus 9z in the lower bracket. Natus Vincere 10-2  paiN Natus Vincere appear to be on track to wrap up Mirage even faster than they had done on Anubis, where they closed things out with a 13-4 scoreline. If the international squad lock down Mirage, they will book themselves an upper-bracket semi-final versus Astralis, while paiN will be fighting for their tournament lives versus fellow South American side 9z. A one-sided blowout was not what anyone had in their cards here, and if they did, it was probably in favor of Spirit, not against. The MongolZ saw SAW's upset over G2 earlier in the day and have done one better by outclassing Spirit in a 2-0 series, making the Russian team look the fool on Anubis. Group A has been thrown into disarray with Spirit now facing G2 in an elimination match, while one of SAW and The MongolZ are guaranteed through to LANXESS Arena. Spirit 4-11  The MongolZ Spirit 4-10  The MongolZ Spirit 4-8  The MongolZ So much for stabilizing, eh? Those four rounds are all that Spirit will go into the second half with after another immense performance from The MongolZ, winning two clean rounds and coming out on top of two brawls for a stellar lead on the notoriously T sided map. Spirit look flustered and have missed grenades and teamflashed each other repeatedly in a similar showing to Ancient. If they can't turn this around, this series will be a wrap. Natus Vincere 3-1  paiN Spirit 4-4  The MongolZ The MongolZ throttled Spirit's offense to kick off Anubis, an aggressive pistol setup and utility to counter early aggression putting them up 4-0 on the CT side. Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets and Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia's entries have righted the tumble, however, and Spirit are right back into the game with four straight. Natus Vincere 13-4  paiN Natus Vincere have kicked off their Cologne campaign in style, recovering from an early 0-3 deficit by procuring 13 of the next 14 rounds, completely outshining paiN on the Brazilians' pick of Anubis. The series is now headed for Mirage, where Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's men will no doubt be holding their heads high after their impressive start to their debut match in Cologne. Spirit 13-16  The MongolZ A masterclass from Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren at the end of Ancient, both in the rounds that helped force overtime and in his calling in overtime. Spirit looked dazed and confused at the end of the map, repeatedly forcing duels and getting caught out by excellent setups and aggressive pushes from The MongolZ. Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia, in particular, had a woeful map, and Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets struggled to convert opening duels (4:9) despite topping the board. Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold came up massive on the opposite side with a 28-17 K-D and a 6:2 record in opening duels, repeatedly shutting down Donut and A attacks. Spirit have a chance to respond on Anubis, but they will need to stabilize and show better teamplay than they did here. Natus Vincere 8-4  paiN Despite a strong start for paiN, powered by heroics from Lucas ""nqz"" Soares, Natus Vincere have managed to stabilize on the offense on their opponent's map pick, securing a solid 8-4 scoreline. The second pistol round will now offer a critical juncture, giving Natus Vincere the opportunity to close out the Brazilian side's map pick with ease, or giving paiN the lifeline they need to kickstart a comeback effort. Natus Vincere 3-4  paiN Spirit 12-12  The MongolZ Spirit 11-10  The MongolZ Natus Vincere 0-3  paiN Spirit 9-7  The MongolZ Spirit looked locked in for double-digits after a crisp double kill from Dmitry ""sh1ro"" Sokolov won them the first gun round, but poor individual duels and sloppy play against Five-SeveNs on B has given The MongolZ a window to get back into the game. Spirit 8-6  The MongolZ Spirit 6-6  The MongolZ The MongolZ let a handful of rounds slip this half — it could well have been a blowout in their favor with some of the advantages and deep positions they held, but Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets and Myroslav ""zont1x"" Plakhotia recovered in late rounds to keep this an even game. Spirit 4-5  The MongolZ The MongolZ keep running rounds down to the wire and it's not paying off. Their early lead is starting to dwindle, and Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets is heating up... 9z 5-13  Astralis After a tight 13-10 victory on 9z's map pick of Dust2, Astralis seemed to have no interest in having a similarly close map on their choice of Inferno, as the Danish side dominated throughout on the map, bagging it with a 13-5 scoreline. Astralis will be preparing for a face-off versus the winner of Natus Vincere versus paiN, while 9z will be squaring off against the loser in the hopes of keeping their IEM Cologne run alive. Spirit 2-3  The MongolZ Spirit 0-2  The MongolZ The MongolZ have a difficult test ahead of them as their map pool does not stack well against Spirit, and they've made it as difficult as possible by picking into one of the Russian team's best maps, Ancient. Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren's side have struggled to show the same form that won them back-to-back titles before the tournament break, and although they have two young guns in Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar and Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold, Spirit have a counter-argument: Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets. 9z 2-10  Astralis This game seems just about done, as Astralis have displayed solid trading and map control throughout their T-side on Inferno, constricting 9z's defense with ease. The Danes are now just three rounds away from booking a series against the winner of Natus Vincere vs. paiN. 9z 2-5  Astralis Despite missing out on the opening pistol round and the subsequent conversion, Astralis have pieced together five rounds in a row on the offense with relative ease, powered by clean shots from Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and impactful lurks from Jakob ""jabbi"" Nygaard. While the game is not out of their grasp just yet, 9z need to compose themselves quickly if they wish to avoid being completely run over on their opponent's map pick. On how he is feeling after the win: What I feel is that what we've been working on is being rewarded. And that is something good, the fact we can replicate in officials what we do in practice. That is the most difficult thing for teams that are on the rise. Now it's about doing it more regularly. Today, we were able to prove that we can beat the best teams in the world. We hope to continue to prove that in the future. On the mentality for the match against G2, one of the favorites in Cologne: Our goal was to go through the Play-In. We managed to accomplish that. Now, it was about doing the best we could. We knew we could beat the best teams in the world in practice, and now it was the perfect moment to prove it. I felt they came in a little bit cold because it was their first match here. We had already played two best-of-threes, and both of them had gone to three maps. I think we were much more comfortable in the game than them and I felt they were a bit shaky. We were calm, we followed the game plan and it worked perfectly. On his expectations for facing Spirit or The MongolZ next: We will have the same mentality we had for this match. We will do our best and show our worth. We've already defeated The MongolZ, but they are a difficult team to play against because they are very good individually. Spirit are probably the best team in the world. Whoever we face, we will approach it the same way, with the same mentality, and we will do our best. 9z 10-13  Astralis Astralis displayed their experience, and 9z their inexperience, on the latter side's pick of Dust2, with the Danes emerging the victors after remaining level-headed in a number of close rounds, capitalizing on the various openings offered up by 9z. The series now heads to Astralis's pick of Inferno, where Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz and his men will be looking to close out their first series in Cologne in 2-0 fashion. 9z 10-11  Astralis After a string of tight, back-and-forth rounds, Astralis have managed to reclaim the lead despite a solid effort on the defense from 9z. With 9z's economy now in tatters, the Danes should be looking to lock in match point on their opponent's pick. Take a bow, SAW, that was some lights-out Counter-Strike. Incredible adaptations, excellent teamplay, trading, and preparation, and a comeback on G2's Inferno pick complete the upset, but make no mistake: this was as legitimate of an underdog win as you could get. G2 are cast down to the lower bracket of Group A and have a brutal path to the playoffs ahead of them now, while SAW will play the winner of Spirit vs. The MongolZ for a spot in the LANXESS. SAW 11-10  G2 A flawless callout of G2's double Banana setup, and this upset is looking like a reality. SAW 9-10  G2 Aggressive peeks from G2 and excellent trading from SAW have made this close, is this come back really on? 9z 5-7  Astralis SAW 5-10  G2 9z 3-3  Astralis SAW 5-7  G2 A stark departure from SAW's dominance on map one thus far, but the Portuguese side salvaged the last two rounds of the half to keep this competitive. G2 were superb in finding entries on the T side, going 9:3 in opening duels as a team while Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač put up a 4:1 record by himself, and if that dominance continues in the second half we'll be headed to Dust2 in no time. 9z 2-3  Astralis Kicking off on the LATAM squad's pick of Dust2, Astralis have found themselves an early lead despite faltering in the first pistol round, succeeding in the second-round force-buy. Although 9z were unsuccessful when responding with a force of their own, Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez and co. have succeeded in the first gun round, allowing them to keep things close early on. All that saving for such an anticlimactic end to the series. Complexity were far and away the better team on Anubis, with the 13-5 scoreline telling its own story. Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski was once again brilliant, but the supporting cast deserves its flowers today, too, with Johnny ""JT"" Theodosiou being the man to get them over the line with a saucy 3k. SAW 13-5  G2 Momentum was hard to come by for G2 all game as SAW never let them string rounds together in the first half and made quick work of the favorites on the CT side with Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto finding three crucial multi-kills in the final three rounds. Complexity 9-4  Virtus.pro SAW 11-5  G2 Who knew it could? Complexity 8-4  Virtus.pro Anubis has been heavily T-sided in the Cologne Play-In (61.4% win-rate), and Complexity have just posted eight on their defense to put themselves in pole position for victory. SAW 9-4  G2 That looked completely unwinnable, but Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa actually made it possible. SAW 8-4  G2 Looking at the scoreboard you'd have a hard time figuring out which team is in the lead, but that's because most rounds SAW won were over moments after they began with G2 forced on saves after early exchanges. SAW 6-2  G2 It's been a tough CT side for G2 so far, who have had to contend with a lightning-fast SAW in the last few rounds. Quick upper hits destroyed the defense, and the Portuguese also survived a Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač 1v3 attempt to grab a healthy lead. Complexity 2-1  Virtus.pro Two back-to-back clutches, first a 1v3 by Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski before a 1v2 by Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery, have given Complexity the lead early on. Complexity 14-16  Virtus.pro Complexity fail to close out a map once again. Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov finally found some impact at the end of Dust2 and clutched a crucial 1v2 in the penultimate round to give his team the platform for success. We're heading to the Anubis decider. The Pole top-fragged on both maps, but his performances were not enough. Complexity 12-12  Virtus.pro FaZe 13-10  Liquid Another strong finish from FaZe as they end it before it gets hairy, losing the first clutch situation on lower but making up for it two rounds later as Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants confirmed the victory in a final 1v1 against Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak. Complexity 11-10  Virtus.pro FaZe 12-8  Liquid Now Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken takes his turn to do a whoopsie as he does an accidental switch mid-engagement in a situation that he might just have had a chance to turn otherwise. FaZe are now on match point after ropz salvaged a jks attempt at a 1v3 clutch. Twistzz accidental switch mid-fight ropz ends jks 2v4 attempt FaZe 10-8  Liquid That's not where you wanna go, right down the vent into a teammate's molotov. FaZe 9-8  Liquid FaZe wrestle back control after stacking the A bombsite with all four players in a 4v5 situation, much to the surprise of Liquid. Perhaps this is what Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen was referring to when he was saying Liquid might not expect a change in FaZe's playstyle. Complexity 9-6  Virtus.pro More went wrong than right for Virtus.pro in that round, but they still somehow came out on top. FaZe 6-7  Liquid Liquid turn a hairy pistol round around off the back of this play from Justin ""jks"" Savage, who picked up four kills and a 1v1 clutch on the way to Liquid's second lead in the map. Complexity 7-5  Virtus.pro Ever since Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski picked up a second sniper, Complexity have been unstoppable and strung five in a row to end the half. FaZe 6-5  Liquid ""This one has that personal touch with Twistzz playing against his old team especially as the IGL, and has that feeling to it that he woke up today like 'I desperately wanna win this match.'"" Ask and you shall receive, Jason ""moses"" O'Toole. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken finds three around squeaky as Liquid begin to recover this CT side. FaZe 5-3  Liquid The SMGs in Liquid's hands cost them up against the AKs and AWP on FaZe's side as they couldn't finish off some kills that they would have otherwise gotten without any problems. FaZe 2-1  Liquid Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak gives Liquid the first gunround on Nuke with some aggresion in yard. Complexity 1-3  Virtus.pro Dust2 started oppositely to Vertigo, as Virtus.pro negated Complexity's pistol-round victory with a forcebuy and ran away to an early 3-1 lead. FaZe exploited the A weaknesses towards the end of the half and that's where they closed it, too. Although nobody stood too far out of the pack, Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard ends on top of the board and deservedly so — the Norwegian picked up a few impact kills in swing duels against Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken in FaZe's A approaches at the end. Complexity 13-6  Virtus.pro A clean victory for Complexity to start the series with a bang. Virtus.pro struggled in anti-ecos and were a much-less cohesive unit than their North American opponents, with Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski the undisputable MVP of the map. Next up is Virtus.pro's pick of Dust2. FaZe 12-10  Liquid Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen called two perfectly timed A executes when Liquid were going for a heavy mid approach and reached map point, but Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak has come to save the day for now. FaZe 11-9  Liquid A clean execute towards an under-manned A from FaZe and Liquid's failed aggressive mid approach means Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company are back in control of the game, and a crucail gunround is coming up. FaZe 8-9  Liquid The game is heating up as we reach the late stages with Liquid now in grasp of the economy after a pistol round win, starring Keith ""NAF"" Markovic's Dualies on B, followed by a sound defense of the A bombsite in the second gunround courtesy of Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's triple. Complexity 7-3  Virtus.pro Complexity's money was at breaking point, but Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski once again came up trumps and found four kills with the hero Galil, of all things. Complexity 6-2  Virtus.pro He sat on 0 frags before this moment, but Michael ""Grim"" Wince delivered when it mattered and clutched a 1v3 for his team. FaZe 6-3  Liquid Liquid have finally found the recipe for success in their heavy middle approaches, as they've found some entries there thanks to meticulous utility usage. After a tough start, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken is having some impact as he's steering the ship out of shallow waters. Complexity 5-1  Virtus.pro I presume most of you are watching the A stream game (and I don't blame you), but I'm just checking in to let you know you're not missing much. Virtus.pro won the pistol but have saved in every round since, with Complexity already running away with the map. Complexity 3-1  Virtus.pro As expected, Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski is leading the way for Complexity. The American superstar sits on 7 kills and 210 ADR after four rounds, with his Galil 2k crucial in COL's second-round forcebuy victory. FaZe 4-0  Liquid So far it's FaZe in control on Liquid's Mirage pick, though, beating back the quick approaches from Twistzz without too much of an issue. karrigan to sjokz on getting out of the rut: ""We extended extra days at home, sacrificed and everything, I see everybody is playing really hard, changing our playstyle coming here and a fresh mindset, and a new foundation for the team. You might think that's hard to do in four days, but at this point I'm ready to risk everything to win the whole thing."" On facing Twistzz: ""He understands how I think in certain scenarios, but I also think looking at how we play lately, Russ also knows that's not normally how we play. It just comes down to focusing on ourselves. We have a little footage on how they play, but at this point it's also about the mind game. The IGL that adapts on the fly will be the one who prevails this game. I believe we're gonna show a different way of playing, maybe they're not ready for that."" Petr ""fame"" Bolyshev appeared in a pre-match broadcast interview and admitted Virtus.pro are not playing at their potential. On preparation after BLAST: ""We tried to learn from those games and fix some of our mistakes. We had four days in Serbia, we were bootcamping, and I hope for the best result here."" On their form: ""We haven't reached our full potential, and we are making mistakes, some individual mistakes. It's all in our hands, we just need to work hard."" Håkon ""hallzerk"" Fjærli spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks ahead of their group stage opener against Virtus.pro. On the community talking about his outbursts: ""I don't care about what other people and experts say. The only opinions I care about are from my teammates."" On the reasons behind them: ""I feel like I miss easy shots and die in stupid ways. When I table slam, it helps me reset faster, get into the round, and try to help my teammates when I'm dead."" Bookies have FaZe as slight favorites in the highlight match of the day, but what do you think? In a match between two teams far from their best, Virtus.pro will meet Complexity in the Cologne opening match. The Russian squad has struggled since adding Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov and suffered elimination at the hands of BIG at the BLAST Groups, but previously reached the semi-final at the Esports World Cup. Petr ""fame"" Bolyshev has seen the biggest dropoff after electroNic's addition, as his average rating plummeted to 0.99 over the last three months. Complexity began their Cologne campaign in the play-in and beat ALTERNATE aTTaX and Eternal Fire without losing a map. Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski unsurprisingly led the way for his team, but their early-season form has been far from convincing otherwise. The bookies favor Virtus.pro slightly, but the match could go either way as both teams aim to get out of their slumps. After three days of the play-in, the eight world's best teams enter the competition on the opening day of the group stage. It's set to kick off in just over an hour with the most closely-contested matches of the bunch between FaZe and Liquid and Virtus.pro and Complexity.

"ultimate on skepticism: ""They have to admit they were wrong""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39598/ultimate-on-skepticism-they-have-to-admit-they-were-wrong,"The Polish AWPer discussed the amazing start to his Liquid career after his team staved off elimination against FURIA. Liquid are through to Group B's lower semi-finals at IEM Cologne 2024 after a convincing 2-0 victory against FURIA, led by Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak, who put in a series-high 1.63 rating. The Polish player has surpassed all expectations and become a fan favorite with his aggressive play style in this new-look Liquid side. ""I'm completely free to do whatever I want during the game,"" he told HLTV after the match against FURIA, also praising Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken for giving him free rein. ""He's helping me to become a better player. But my game is in it, for sure."" The initial skepticism about his signing doesn't surprise him, but he knows that he is doing more than enough to repay the faith Twistzz placed in him. ""They can say whatever they want. It's their opinion. I cannot be mad about it. But, you know, they have to admit they were wrong."" A 2-0 victory in your first elimination match. What are your thoughts on this series? Only positive thoughts. We won, right? I'm enjoying my time here. I'm not too focused on the outcome because I can't control it. I'm just learning. It's a learning phase for me right now. First tournaments, first big tournaments, let's say. Only positive thoughts. Even when you lose. What happened in that round on Dust2, where you couldn't plant the bomb? Was there some miscommunication? Did Twistzz just forget that he had the bomb with him? I don't know actually, but it didn't affect us. That's the most important thing. We didn't focus too much on that. Unlucky, and we move on. Fair enough. Twistzz said before the match that the team had a game plan for Nuke, that you felt ready on this map. And it seemed from the beginning that you were taking fights everywhere, that you weren't giving FURIA any respect and that you were trying to take as much control of the map as possible. What happened in that game? Yeah, it was a good game, very enjoyable. We were not pressured at all. So we took it for granted, like, all the places. I'm always playing aggressively. It's not based on the playbook, a game plan or whatever. I'm just trying to play my game. I wanted to ask you about your amazing start in Liquid. When you joined the team, some people had some doubts that you were ready to play at this level. Has it been easier than you expected? I wouldn't say easier. I had been here before. Like, I played ESL Pro League 15, it was like two years ago. So I kind of knew what I was going to experience. Not too much, but I knew a little bit. It's still hard but I'm glad I'm making it, you know? There were a lot of comments, like, 'Maybe this guy is not ready to play at the highest level.' Were you determined to prove people wrong when you saw those comments? They can say whatever they want. It's their opinion. I cannot be mad about it. They are entitled to think such things. I came from nowhere, let's say. I came from a Polish team that not a lot of people know about. But, you know, they have to admit they were wrong. What sort of instructions does Twistzz give you during the games? We were looking at your stats and you're getting a lot of opening kills at CT. You're also closing out some rounds on the T side. Does he just let you do your own thing during games? Yeah, I'm completely free to do whatever I want during the game. Of course, I'm not overextending because we want to win. I'm not going to play too aggressively, let's say. But whenever I have a question, I'm just asking, he's answering. He's helping me become a better player. But my game is in it, for sure. And what are the differences between Twistzz as an IGL and the other IGLs you've had in your career? The biggest difference I've seen is the freedom in the game. Normally, IGLs are taking a lot more space in the game for themselves. I feel that Twistzz is very reasonable about it. Everyone has a space in the team. Everyone is free. You still have two matches to play in the group stage to make it to the playoffs. Are you confident the team can make it out of the groups and into the playoffs? Yes. I'm confident in my team's ability. I'm confident in my ability, so we'll see. Cannot be sure. What would it mean to you to play in the LANXESS, one of the biggest arenas in esports? It would be an amazing experience, playing on the stage. That's every esports player's dream. I cannot wait.",12-8-2024 17:40,1723477200000
Vitality through to LANXESS after FaZe win,https://www.hltv.org/news/39601/vitality-through-to-lanxess-after-faze-win,"FaZe drop down to the lower bracket to play Falcons. Vitality have defeated FaZe in a close-fought three-map series (Inferno 8-13, Dust2 16-12, Anubis 13-9) to secure a spot in the IEM Cologne playoffs. The game was decided in small details, with Vitality winning a second-round forcebuy after losing the pistol three times across the series. A couple of 1v1 clutches by Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan and Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi were also crucial in helping the team take control of Anubis late. ""When I was planting the bomb I heard my heartbeat, and I don't like that. But I'm happy I won it, it was a stressful one,"" flameZ described his clutch in a post-match interview. For FaZe, this isn't the end of their Cologne campaign yet. The European combine came into the event in dire form, with Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen admitting he is ""ready to risk everything to win the whole thing."" While they weren't able to win, their performance against a top-six side was an encouraging one, as a few clutches could have turned the tide and helped them move to the playoffs. FaZe now drop down to the lower bracket to face Falcons, while Vitality will play MOUZ for a semi-final spot. The series began on Inferno, where FaZe's aggressive economic decisions meant they prevailed in the opening force-buy wars and ran away to a 9-3 lead in the first half. Vitality then won a second-round force buy on their offense but ran out of steam before they could worry the FaZe side, who took the series lead with a 13-8 win. Clip: FaZe turn 2v5 to find nine rounds on offense Vitality went for a Dust2 pick and started the map in hot form to take an early 8-1 lead, but a resilient FaZe put together a three-round streak to end the half.

"xertioN on facing Vitality: ""A good match to test our level""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39600/xertion-on-facing-vitality-a-good-match-to-test-our-level,"The Israeli opener isn't worried that his team has looked a bit off the pace at times in Cologne. MOUZ have punched their ticket to the playoff stage of IEM Cologne 2024 after beating Complexity 2-0 in Group B's upper semi-finals. It marks the team's return to the LANXESS arena after they missed out on a playoff spot last year. The EPL 19 champions are now set to face Vitality in a seeding match, with the winner skipping the first round of the playoffs and going straight to the semi-finals. After the match against Complexity, Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman sat down with HLTV and discussed the team's slow starts in Cologne, the preparation for the event, and his playoff expectations. A 2-0 victory against Complexity and you're through to the LANXESS for the first time in your career. With MOUZ being a German organization, how important was it for the team to make it into the playoffs? Very, especially after last year's failure. I think everyone on the team felt really bad, for us but also for the organization, because they've done everything to give us a good system and a new facility that we can now practice in. They're doing all the right things, so I'm just happy to pay back a bit. Talking a little bit about the series, Vertigo was looking a little bit shaky at first. They had that 5-0 start, but then, you got into your stride and you took control of the game, pretty much. Sometimes, we have some slow starts as a team. It happens quite frequently and it's something we're working on. Against Falcons, it was better. A bit of an off-start, I would say, but once we got into our groove, we showed that we are a better team than them, and I think that everyone played really well today. Nuke was a very close game, but you pulled through in the end. Did you expect such a tight game? Yeah, of course. Complexity are always tough to play against, they're really good. I'm a big fan of EliGE, I think he's a great player. Today, it was kind of tough for me, I felt a little bit out of it. I'm just happy that my team pulled through and happy to win, even though I didn't play my best. Are you worried that some of the games that you have played here haven't been very clean? No, I think that everyone is having some scrappy games at the top level. I think there is no best team in the world at this moment. Obviously, we want to be so in the future, but there is a lot of work ahead of us for us to achieve it. We're going to take it step by step. Bad game or whatever, we've still won two games. There are even teams like Spirit that are already out, which is incredibly surprising. Just take it step by step and move forward. Most of the teams here came straight from the BLAST Fall Groups, but that was not your case. You had, like, three weeks to prepare for this tournament. What did you work on? And are you happy that you had all that extra time to prepare for this event? What we worked on is a bit of a secret, but I think we put in really good work coming into here. We also had a really good bootcamp, we had some good talks with each other, some team bonding with our sports psychologist. In general, I think it's just nice to have the bootcamp facility of MOUZ now because it kind of feels like a second home at this point already. I think we did all the right things, and I just hope to keep showing it, we have a seeding game, and after that in the LANXESS arena. Yesterday against Falcons, you had a very strong start to the series with a very one-sided new game, and torzsi had that team kill towards the end. But the series ended up being a very close one. Do you think that maybe you underestimated them a little bit after that easy first game? Not too much. Mentally, I think it's always difficult to reset to the mindset of that they're a really good team because we won the first map very convincingly. But we knew they're a really scrappy team and that they can always bring back rounds. They have a lot of experienced players. It happened, but I think overall we were just prepared to win. Heading into this event, most people would put Spirit, G2 and NAVI as the favorites. Spirit are already out. What do you think about your chances in the playoffs? Because there's always that question of whether you guys can do it on the big stage. I think everyone has the same chance. Whoever deserves it more and puts in the better work will win the tournament. I'm not really thinking about it in this moment. I just want to take it step by step and show up as a team every single game. It doesn't matter if it's in a quarter-final or semi-final. Hopefully, we make it as far as we can. Overall, I'm just looking forward to playing there. You're now going to play the winner of FaZe vs Vitality. What are your expectations for this seeding match? I think it's in the third map now, it's like 8-8 or something. It's always a brawl between these two teams. I'm not sure what to expect. We will gladly take on either team. I think it's going to be a good match to test our level at this point. They are two very good teams. Looking forward to facing whoever.",12-8-2024 20:47,1723488420000
G2 continue Cologne resurgence with Astralis win,https://www.hltv.org/news/39602/g2-continue-cologne-resurgence-with-astralis-win,"Two dominant showings on Dust2 and Ancient were enough to keep G2 in the tournament. G2 have eliminated Astralis from IEM Cologne after defeating the Danes in a three-map series (Dust2 13-1, Mirage 9-13, Ancient 13-3). Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and company will now face off against the winner of The MongolZ vs. paiN for a playoff spot. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, who topped the server in the series, was in a joyous mood in the post-match interview. ""I'm doing my best to make it to the stage, so I'm happy and super proud,"" he said. ""I don't feel any pressure because the boys made me feel comfortable. Anchoring isn't that strange to me, but I still need to get used to it and learn when to go aggressive."" The win continues G2's impressive return to form after their opening loss to SAW. They demolished Spirit on Sunday and were utterly dominant on two of the three maps against Astralis. G2's stats since SAW loss: Astralis, who won 2 out of the first 21 rounds in the series, exit IEM Cologne after a couple of lackluster performances. They followed their opening win against 9z by being outclassed on four out of five maps against Natus Vincere and G2 and thus suffered an early elimination. Their CT sides have been especially woeful, as they averaged a 34.4% win rate in Cologne despite a comfortable opening victory. ""They outclassed us today,"" said a distraught Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz in the post-match interview. ""No excuses, just not good enough. A lot of responsibility is on me in terms of putting the guys in better situations and finding the path we need to take. I don't have the answers right now, but we need to change something in our approach to the game."" The series began with G2 demolishing Astralis on the Dane's pick of Dust2, with NiKo and company even having some fun and getting a couple of knife kills. Clip: NiKo demolishes Astralis in second-half pistol Next up was Mirage, where Astralis completed a miraculous turnaround from 1-6 down on the CT side. Martin ""stavn"" Lund and device in particular had a resurgence on the offense, and the Danes looked like an entirely different team all of a sudden to put together a 9-2 T side and close out a 13-9 victory. G2 returned to their best on Ancient, however, and pummeled an Astralis side devoid of confidence into the ground in a 13-3 victory to eliminate the Danes from IEM Cologne in 9-12th place.

paiN stay alive after The MongolZ meltdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39604/pain-stay-alive-after-the-mongolz-meltdown,"The Brazilians repeat their victory over bLitz's side from the Major after a scrappy three-map series. paiN have lived on to fight another day in Cologne after beating The MongolZ in a whirlwind three-map series that began with a chess match between Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren and Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt, but quickly devolved into individual highlights and brutal mistakes from both sides. The MongolZ made critical errors when it mattered most, losing two crucial 1v3s to biguzera and repeatedly fumbling rounds to low buys and pistols to be cast out of Cologne in the group stage only a day after being mere rounds away from the playoffs. paiN weren't without mistakes of their own, starting from before the series even began with their insistence on playing Anubis despite picking and losing it four straight times in Cologne to Liquid, MIBR, Natus Vincere, 9z, and now a fifth to The MongolZ. ""I don't know dude,"" biguzera said when asked in a post-match interview why he continues to pick the map despite the losses. ""In Brazil we were winning it like, 90% of the time, we were amazing there and here we make some mistakes that we don't usually make. I don't know, maybe next time I won't, maybe I will, I don't know (laughs)."" The MongolZ will lament a tragic end to their run in Cologne after they smashed Spirit in their opening game of Stage 2, only to squander a chance to advance to the playoffs against SAW and now get cat out by paiN in the lower bracket. biguzera's side are now just one series away from making it to LANXESS Arena, but have a fearsome G2 standing in their way. Save for a highlight round from the Brazilian captain and from Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk in the first half, paiN came out on their pick completely flat and tallied just three rounds in the first half as Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold and The MongolZ ripped through the defenses. paiN won the pistol and conversion, but the map looked over after The MongolZ hit map point, 12-5, only for biguzera to call a fantastic T side and bring things all the way back to 12-11. The MongolZ looked like they had stopped the comeback at the final hurdle in round 24, but grievous errors and an expertly-played 1v3 by biguzera allowed paiN to force overtime before The MongolZ finally hunkered down and closed out the map. Clip: biguzera's 1v3 to force overtime The T side Anubis chess match devolved into a chaotic carnival of individual prowess on Mirage, with clutch rounds going either way, ecos traded off, and some spectacular multi-kills out of Munkhbold ""Senzu"" Azbayar, Lucas ""nqz"" Soares, and João ""snow"" Vinicius keeping the game at even keel at the break. The MongolZ struggled to halt paiN's entries in the second half, however, although rounds weren't clean and the Counter-Strike played led to Mohan ""launders"" Govindasamy and Conner ""Scrawny"" Girvan breaking down in laughter. There were two moments where The MongolZ were in pole position to wrap the series up in two maps, though: Once when they lost to an eco rush on A, and another at 10-11 when bLitz shoved all-in with a brazen MP9 force-buy call for his whole team. That decision looked like it had paid dividends after an Apartments push got The MongolZ a 3v1 advantage, but baffling decisions gave away the ghost and enabled another clutch from biguzera that let paiN snatch the win. Clip: biguzera's second 1v3 capitalizes on MongolZ's mistakes It is a miracle that The MongolZ came back from that tilter of a loss to briefly post a lead on the Nuke decider, winning a force-buy war to sit up 6-2 on the T side, but it didn't last. nqz and Lucas ""lux"" Meneghini came alive and powered paiN to a ten-round spree to hit map point, and insult was added to injury when two saving MongolZ players went down with the bomb just before the defeat was sealed.",12-8-2024 23:38,1723498680000

Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz's reign as IGL began with a bang as Astralis made four consecutive semi-finals, beginning at IEM Chengdu and ending at YaLLa Compass. Their final pre-summer-break tournament at the BLAST Spring Final didn't go as well, however, as they could only beat underdogs SAW. Their form after the break isn't one of a world-beating team either, with the team squeezing through the BLAST Groups after a win against Ninjas in Pyjamas and now suffering an early elimination in Cologne, prompting Martin ""stavn"" Lund to say the team needs to go ""back to the drawing board."" After Astralis' elimination against G2, stavn spoke to HLTV about the match against Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski and company, the team going missing on two of the three maps, and their expectations for the rest of the year. stavn, a 2-1 defeat, and you guys are out of the tournament after a very weird series. How would you describe what happened? On Dust2, we just got fucked, honestly. It was our map pick, and we thought it was like a punish pick, but to be honest, we lost the pistol, and that's how it is. In the first couple of rounds, I didn't feel like we followed our game plan, and there was just a tense feeling while playing. If you want to play a good series, you need to be able to be calm and enjoy it, and I don't feel like anyone did. Yeah, we just got wrecked. You lost 19 of the first 21 rounds of the series. Are you happy with your response on Mirage? And how do you think the team managed to find the strength to come back after such a big deficit? The one good thing to take away from this series is the comeback on Mirage. We had a really good game plan on Mirage, and we followed it there, and we believed that we could come back. We gained some momentum on the T side, and then we just kept rolling because we had a good read on how they would respond to different things. Really happy with the comeback on Mirage. Do you think that there was maybe some disrespect from G2's players? Because in that first round on Mirage, there was the knife kill. Do you think they got a bit too confident and lost some focus during their game? Sure, they were playing with full confidence. They are playing really well at the moment, you could also see it in the game against Spirit, they absolutely destroyed them as well. When they are pulling out knives, obviously, it's disrespectful, you know? I've been on teams before when we were destroying a team like that, and it's the easiest thing to do. It's just disrespect. It was quite a contested start to Ancient. You had some close rounds, but then towards the midway point of the first half, it seemed like you guys stopped believing. What happened there? Yeah, I agree. On Ancient, midway through, there were a lot of frustrations. On the Ancient CT side, we were usually really good, but we couldn't play our game against them. Malbs was playing really well on Mid and denying our typical Mid control, so it was hard. device looked very stressed when the camera was on him at times. What can you say about these past few months when things haven't been going your way, and results haven't been what you expected? It's always hard coming back after a player break. You need to find the groove again, and I would say we have done that in some moments in some games. But I feel like after the break, we haven't really found our top game yet. And when you are losing rounds the way we are, then obviously some frustration comes out. So we just need to fix it. Your series against NAVI and G2 show that you are still not quite at that level yet. What do you think that the team is still lacking? This game against G2, and also the NAVI game, are obviously teams that we want to be able to compete with. They are top teams, title contenders, and we want to be there as well, and we haven't shown that we are there yet. I feel like before the player break, we showed it. So we just need to keep working to come to that level. How confident are you for the rest of the season? You now have Pro League and the BLAST Fall Final, a very important event for you, and also the RMRs and the Major. What goals have you set for the rest of the year? Right now, it's obviously tough, but we just need to look forward. Cologne is an important tournament, but the most important is obviously the Major. That's the goal for every team and the main goal for us. So now we have some decent time to be able to practice and look at what we need to fix. So we need to just get back on the drawing board, as you say.",13-8-2024 11:44,1723542240000
"Snax: ""Today we played pretty nice CS""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39605/snax-today-we-played-pretty-nice-cs,"The Polish captain praised his team's performance in the elimination series against Astralis. G2 have survived their second elimination series at IEM Cologne as they moved past Astralis, setting up a Group A lower bracket final against paiN on Tuesday. The international team picked up comfortable wins on Dust2 and Ancient either side of a close loss on Mirage, where Astralis managed to rally back from 6-1 down. After the series, Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski had nothing but praise for his team. ""The way we played today, the comms and the energy on the team were pretty nice,"" he said. Looking ahead to Tuesday's match, Snax said that he expects his team to come out with the same intensity they showed against Spirit and Astralis. A victory will see Snax step onto the LANXESS arena stage for the first time since 2016, when he helped Virtus.pro reach the semi-finals. Snax, a 2-1 victory. A weird series, I'd say. How are you feeling? Why weird? I mean, it was a normal match. Sometimes you win with pretty good scores, sometimes you struggle in some of the halves. I'm pretty fine, obviously, with the score. I would say that today we played pretty nice CS. The only bad half, I would say, was CT Mirage. Maybe we focused too much on helping me on B instead of playing, like, maybe default. I'm not sure, I'm not going to leak everything. But I would say that the way we played today, the comms and the energy on the team were pretty nice. You won 19 of the first 21 rounds of the series, but then it seemed that the intensity dropped on Mirage.  Do you think the players lost a little bit of focus after that amazing start? I wouldn't say so. On Dust2, we also had a good score and we kept it cool the entire T side. So I would say it was the same. We just lost the pistol, then some close rounds, and it was just hard to come back. After Mirage, what was the team talk like? What did you discuss before the final map? I said, 'Ancient is a pretty good map for us. Just forget about Mirage, it doesn't matter now. We still have one map to win' I just wanted to reset, I wanted all the guys to chill before Ancient. I said, like, 'I think I have a good plan against them on the T side. Even if we win the knife, we take T side.' We started on the T side and it looked pretty good. Also, insane plays from Mario malbsMd and everyone else on the team. It was nice to see. Are there any valuable lessons that you can take from that Mirage game for the rest of the tournament? Yes, but I'm not going to reveal every secret of my thinking, of my knowledge of CS, but for sure there are. We're going to talk after the match. Individually, I can say that maybe I wanted too much to help the guys today. On Dust2, I feel that we all played really well. On the second and third map, I felt like I wanted too much but my guys were trading so I was okay with that. We showed solid CS today overall. You're now going to face the winner of paiN vs The MongolZ. What are your expectations for this match? I think both teams are solid. We could see after the SAW game we had struggles and they beat us pretty convincingly in this BO3. I think if we just go with the same energy we had versus Spirit and Astralis, we can win it. If you qualify for the playoffs, it will be your first time at the LANXESS arena since 2016. What would that mean for you? Obviously, I always love to play in front of a crowd. It's always fun, you know, to listen to the people shout and cheer for the teams. It would be nice. I would rather play in Katowice. You know, for the Polish crowd.

Liquid and FaZe are through to the Group B lower bracket final after taking down Complexity and Falcons, respectively, in 2-0 series at the beginning of the final day of IEM Cologne's group stage. The two teams are set for a rematch from the opening round of the groups, in which FaZe came out on top after two close maps, this time facing off in a do-or-die match for a spot in the playoffs. In their match against Complexity, Liquid opted for an Ancient pick despite having only played the map once before in this lineup, in their opener against Virtus.pro at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups. Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak had his first quiet map of Cologne, but Liquid's riflers made up for the missing AWPer to secure a close win on the opening map. Keith ""NAF"" Markovic, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and Justin ""jks"" Savage all put up rounds to recover a slow start on the Terrorist side, and Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis made his impact known once on CT, with his consecutive triples in a B defense and a 2v4 retake on A keeping Liquid in the fight. Another jks clutch proved to be the turning point in the game, as it once again prevented Liquid's economy from being broken after they gave up the previous round to pistols. Clip: jks turns the game with a 1v2 spraydown After the close affair on the first map, Anubis turned out a one-sided one. Complexity were competitive in the opening stages thanks to a pistol win and a Michael ""Grim"" Wince 1v3 clutch, but Liquid quickly got on the board on the CT side with what is becoming a signature MP9 third-round halfbuy for them and went on to pull off a solid CT side from that point. Clip: Twistzz 1v2s in Liquid's signature MP9 halfbuy A shutout on the Terrorist side followed with ultimate finding his confidence again off the back of an ace in the first half, making quick plays down Middle and finding entries there. FaZe were matched up against Falcons, with Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company taking on the role of massive favorite in the match despite their recent struggles. Dust2 began with an 8-0 streak for FaZe, during which Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard demolished the Falcons offense and racked up 17 kills in the first half. Falcons posted a four-round streak at the end of the half, however, and eventually secured overtime despite Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants's 1v3 turning the tide late on. Clip: broky wins 1v3 to keep the lead for FaZe FaZe then dialed back their aggression and put together a dominant overtime display to take the map 16-13 and move the series to their pick of Ancient. The second map saw a back-and-forth start, where neither team was able to take control after a couple of clutches and force-buy victories. The turning point came in FaZe's Five-Seven buy that took them up 8-6 and completely turned the momentum, with karrigan and company tallying a 5-0 streak after that to stay alive in Cologne.

IEM Cologne groups day 3 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39594/iem-cologne-groups-day-3-as-it-happened,"The MongolZ 6-12  paiN The MongolZ 6-10  paiN The MongolZ 6-7  paiN The MongolZ 6-6  paiN There was little doubt in mind that the chaos would stop in this series after those first two maps, and rest assured, it has not. Three 1vX clutches in the first half alone, an early force-buy war, and narrow margins have kept this game close, but its paiN who head into the second half with the mental edge after sweeping the last four rounds to recover from 2-6 down. I'll let you figure that one out on your own. Hint: it has something to do with beating Martin ""stavn"" Lund. G2 13-3  Astralis Another clinic by G2 keeps them alive in Cologne, while Astralis exit the tournament with a whimper after a couple of terrible CT sides. The MongolZ 4-2  paiN G2 9-3  Astralis G2 look like the team from Dust2, nothing is working for Astralis once again, and Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa is just running around headshotting people. This one might be over. G2 4-2  Astralis G2 3-2  Astralis The MongolZ 10-13  paiN That may be one of the most chaotic, highlight-filled, exciting, and messy maps of Counter-Strike I've watched in a long time, and we could be in for another as paiN have forced a Nuke decider. By no means should we be in this position, given the late back-and-forth and The MongolZ's ballsy force-buy, but that clutch from Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt will haunt them for a long time if they are eliminated after this. G2 3-1  Astralis Astralis never stood a chance. The MongolZ 10-12  paiN What a ballsy call from Garidmagnai ""bLitz"" Byambasuren to force with MP9s there, and it paid off — at least until they completely threw it away with a disastrously played 3vs1. The MongolZ 10-10  paiN The MongolZ 8-6  paiN G2 9-13  Astralis Astralis, who won 12 rounds in their last three maps in Cologne, have turned around a 1-6 deficit to take Mirage. Martin ""stavn"" Lund and Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz in particular had a resurgence on the offense, and the Danes looked like an entirely different team all of a sudden to put together a 9-2 T side. It feels like they will have the upper hand on Ancient in terms of morale, too. This is the kind of mental resilience I expect from my FACEIT teammates. The MongolZ 6-6  paiN A very back-and-forth half thus far, filled with individual highlights and some great teamplay to create space. Every single round feels like it's been close and within reach for both sides, but it's MongolZ who head into the second half with a win after Usukhbayar ""910"" Banzragch cracked open B in round 12 to tie the score. G2 10-12  Astralis G2 9-9  Astralis Astralis have shown some incredible mental to bring this back to even. Their teamplay is back and so is their aim, while G2 have just burned through their last timeout on the map. G2 9-8  Astralis The MongolZ 2-4  paiN G2 8-6  Astralis A lot more is needed, but Astralis' B attack in the pistol started them on the right foot. The MongolZ 1-3  paiN G2 6-3  Astralis Astralis have shown signs of life for the first time in the series by winning two consecutive rounds, and G2 are down to an eco in the next. G2 4-1  Astralis It's not looking any better on Mirage for Astralis, even their round wins look bad. The MongolZ 16-13  paiN It should never have been that close, but at least we got a thrilling map out of it. From a chess match to a brawl, overtime was all individuals. The MongolZ swept the CT side, with Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk spraying down four to briefly keep paiN alive after the side swap before an A execute closed out the map. The MongolZ's pick of Mirage is next. The MongolZ 15-12  paiN G2 1-0  Astralis The MongolZ 12-12  paiN The MongolZ 12-10  paiN Somehow, this has gotten close. paiN won the pistol and conversion, but it was looking done after The MongolZ won three in a row in dominant fashion to hit map point. But Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt is calling a masterclass right now, and this game is suddenly exciting with overtime on the horizon. Just like that, G2 take the lead in the series. Astralis will need some fresh air after this one. It's still 0-0 lads. He has a point, to be fair. G2 11-1  Astralis Victor ""Staehr"" Staehr is not having a good time, and neither are his teammates. G2 7-0  Astralis G2 6-0  Astralis Another quick win for incoming for G2? They seem to be feeling it, and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov just knifed Alexander ""br0"" Bro. The MongolZ 9-3  paiN That was a brutal half for paiN on their Anubis pick, a quad kill round from Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt and triple from Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk being all they had to their name until the last round of the half. Ayush ""mzinho"" Batbold is fired up and is all smiles while shouting across the hall... what he's saying is anyone's guess, but there's no denying it's fun to see. Another 1v1 (this one by Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi) goes the way of Vitality in the final round, and Vitality are in the LANXESS. It was an exciting game of Counter-Strike between two heavyweights, and FaZe did look better than their recent performances. FaZe 9-10  Vitality Now Vitality take a one-round lead, and FaZe are out of money. FaZe 9-8  Vitality Some classic FaZe bullshit late on Anubis, and FaZe have just kept their nose ahead after winning an unlikely round. A kick in the teeth for Complexity, who couldn't close out Nuke despite having the economic and positional advantage in rounds at the end of the map. MOUZ 11-11  Complexity MOUZ 9-11 Complexity Complexity are exploiting Door and looking like they could well force a third map, despite some well-timed pushes from MOUZ. FaZe 6-6  Vitality Vitality will be more than happy about posting six on the notoriously difficult Anubis CT side. The right players are on top of the scoreboard, too, as Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi (12 kills) and Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut (11) lead the way. MOUZ 8-8  Complexity FaZe 2-3  Vitality Would have worked if Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut found the bomb a bit quicker. MOUZ 6-6  Complexity Save for Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo's triple and a second-round force-buy win, MOUZ didn't have an ideal start to their map pick. Attempts to abuse Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery at Ramp went wayward, and when MOUZ tried to change the pace with an A site execute, a missed Hut Molotov spelled their doom and allowed floppy to find another multi-kill. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek was not dissuaded, however, and called an A site rush immediately after, and that half-buy win helped the European team steal away momentum and win the final four of the half. FaZe 1-1  Vitality MOUZ 1-3  Complexity FaZe 12-16  Vitality FaZe ran out of steam in overtime and allowed Vitality to run away with the map, 16-12. William ""mezii"" Merriman and Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi locked down the B site and built a great platform for an explosive B attack on the T side, which proved enough to tie up the series. On to Anubis! FaZe 12-12  Vitality After being 1-8 down on the CT side, FaZe came back to force overtime on Dust2. Game on! MOUZ 13-9  Complexity From 0-5 to 11-5, MOUZ had their way with Complexity for much of this map after a slow start. A pistol clutch from Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo in the second half increased their seven-round streak from the first half to 11, and a late resurgence from Complexity came too little, too late with Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek finding impactful entries to help MOUZ close. We're headed to Nuke next. FaZe 7-10  Vitality FaZe 6-9  Vitality FaZe 4-8  Vitality A three-round streak by FaZe gives them somethinfg to work with, but it hasn't been a great showing by Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company. MOUZ 7-5  Complexity Complexity's hot start is a distant memory already after MOUZ won all remaining rounds in the first half, starting their streak with a half-buy robbery and continuing it with multis from Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo and Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás. Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski went from 7-1 to 8-8, with his attempts to force the issue at Ramp faltering once Ludvig ""Brollan"" Brolin got on the board and MOUZ put some more support around him. FaZe 1-5  Vitality Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire is leading the way for Vitality, with the French captain sitting on five kills — four of which have been entries. MOUZ 0-5  Complexity Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski is having his way with Ludvig ""Brollan"" Brolin on Vertigo's A Ramp right now, the former sitting upon a 7-1 K-D while the Swede is kill-less five rounds in. FaZe 0-1  Vitality FaZe 13-8  Vitality FaZe made it work with some less-than-ideal buys for their final two rounds and close it before it gets any more dangerous on their own pick. They're just one map away from LANXESS now, with Dust2 up next. FaZe 11-6  Vitality Another second-round forcebuy went the way of Vitality, but FaZe have stopped the rot early thanks to this stalwart defense of B from Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen: Not much in terms of soundbites, but this interview speaks volumes about Virtus.pro's mental state. Changes inc? Five losses in a row for Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov's Virtus.pro, and another 13-16th placed exit. Falcons now march on to face the loser of FaZe-Vitality. FaZe 9-3  Vitality Inferno began with up 3-2 after they won the second-round forcebuy and a couple of clutches from Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut, but couldn't make the landing stick in a 5v3 up against an apps explosion from FaZe in the following round. From there FaZe went on a seven-round run. Robin ""ropz"" Kool dominated around apps and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský found some key entries to kick off the streak, and it ended with Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants and Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard turning a 2v5 on B. Falcons 10-7  Virtus.pro Falcons have recovered from bad starts to halves twice on Dust2, doing what they couldn't on Mirage. A true team performance helping them there too, with most of the round timer spent on hunts around the map for VP's saving players. Falcons 5-4  Virtus.pro The flying USP from Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen! Falcons 1-3  Virtus.pro But like last map, Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković's team are not doing too hot so far. The Montenegran has five kills in two rounds but Falcons need more. NAF to sjokz on ultimate: ""He's a super confident AWPer, super aggressive as everyone can see. I'm happy he's making a good name for himself. A lot of times when players come in they're a little nervous and they start a little slow, and then people start to doubt them. But he's playing with full confidence and he's playing well."" On resilience and mentality after going down on Dust2: ""There's been a lot of games where we were having struggles, and we took a timeout to say, 'We just need to start playing a little bit more aggressive, in their face, and confident. That's pretty much what happened when we were down 11-8 on Dust2. mithR took a timeout and just said, 'Guys, we're playing like a bunch of pussies, we need to start getting aggressive.'"" Liquid 13-4  FURIA Liquid deal FURIA a tough blow to go along with their early group stage elimination. Both pistol rounds won, and yet the Brazilians only came away with four rounds in total. It was a struggle from beginning to end up against a Liquid squad that was more than ready to brawl ever since Dust2 reached the late stages. What on earth did we just watch. Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković was on a tear, but constant force buys and hero AKs allowed VP back into the game and Falcons end Mirage with ZERO T rounds. Dust2 will decide. Falcons 8-8  Virtus.pro It's a 6-1 scoreline in the last seven as VP rally on Mirage. It helps that Falcons did just enough damage to keep forcing, and their lead is gone as they buy up fully for the first time as T. FURIA 2-10  Liquid It all began with that half-ass buy lobby crunch and it's ended in a round that Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros and Kaike ""KSCERATO"" Cerato went into with zero money in the bank after they were hunted down trying to save, after time ran out. This has been a brutal clinic from Liquid. FURIA 2-7  Liquid Liquid have been playing in FURIA's faces all half long and there has been no response from the Brazilians for the past seven rounds. Preventing the early aggression has proved impossible, and FURIA look completely out of this game now. FURIA 2-2  Liquid Liquid went for a rather curious halfbuy with some MP9s and went for a lobby crunch with it, and in the end Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken clutched a 1v2 to convert the round. This buy is something similar we saw from FURIA earlier in the tournament, and Eternal Fire as well. Falcons 7-2  Virtus.pro Emil ""Magisk"" Reif should've known what he was getting into trying to flank Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali in a 4v1, but still finds time to shout across at Mr. Supersaver Falcons 4-1  Virtus.pro A proactive Falcons are disrupting VP early on in map two, and the constant mid pushes and flanks are working — but they let go of a 4v2 here. Liquid went back to their brawly nature once the game hit overtime and ran with the chaos, securing the first map despite the horrid start on the CT side. As has been custom for Liquid in Cologne so far, Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak ends the map on top of the scoreboard again. The Pole was running around the map making himself difficult to predict, and it was working for him more often than not. We all thought Vertigo would become more T sided after the changes, but that has not quite materialised in practice — until now. CT sides have struggled immensely in Cologne, particularly Virtus.pro's. ""Sometimes we're struggling, especially on Vertigo,"" admitted David ""n0rb3r7"" Danielyan pre-game and that has continued. Mirage next. Liquid 15-12  FURIA Complete chaos ensued in the final round of the first OT half as Liquid re-aggress and then double down on the re-aggress and re-aggress again, everywhere, all the time. And it works. Falcons 13-11  Virtus.pro That's a 10 round T half for Falcons and how fitting that Emil ""Magisk"" Reif — who struggled immensely on B on CT — closes it out with a quad kill in the 3on5 clutch. Liquid 14-12  FURIA A double AWP setup on long and it's Keith ""NAF"" Markovic, not Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak getting all the kills. Liquid 12-12  FURIA With Twistzz adding on a quad-kill to YEKINDAR's triple, Liquid were on the recovery mission but failed to convert a match point in the final round of regulation as their aggressive moves on long and short didn't pan out. Falcons 9-11  Virtus.pro VP finally won two CT rounds, but they're snapped straight back with a Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer clutch on B. Liquid 9-11  FURIA A seven-round streak is brought to an end as FURIA's double AWP buy on the Terrorist side doesn't work out. Falcons 7-9  Virtus.pro The T sided nature of the new Vertigo continues, and Falcons are looking far better since the side swap all over the map. Even Emil ""Magisk"" Reif is trending up, with a triple kill on an anti-eco and a 1on2 clutch here. Liquid 8-9  FURIA Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros is on 14 kills in five rounds in the second half now. Liquid 8-8  FURIA He was having a slow start to the game on the CT side, but Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros has now racked up four multi-kills in a row — some against ecos, of course, but one could have gotten hairy — and the game is even now. Falcons 2-8  Virtus.pro Falcons have no answer on B. The only round they won was when VP went A, and Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García got a triple from Sandbags. Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen and Emil ""Magisk"" Reif are having a nightmare, and Petr ""fame"" Bolyshev is the one behind it. Liquid 7-4  FURIA I guess nobody was looking at the time, or Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken didn't realize he had the bomb? Falcons 1-5  Virtus.pro Emil ""Magisk"" Reif and Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen are having to fight blind and burning on B as Virtus.pro hit them with execute after execute. Big lead already. Liquid 5-3  FURIA Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo has come to play early as he is roaming around middle with the AWP with a lot of success, as his collateral in round 7 and a double in a B retake giving FURIA a way back in. Liquid 5-1  FURIA The game is beginning to run away from the Brazilians with Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak already making his presence known with an AWP triple in the first gunround. Meanwhile, Keith ""NAF"" Markovic is having fun with his former teammate as he caught him from behind with a knife. Liquid 2-1  FURIA Marcelo ""chelo"" Cespedes's quad-kill in a B retake gave Brazilians the pistol and then went for an AWP purchase in round two while the rest of his team went for some MP9s. Their aggressive push up middle backfired, and so did the AWP purchase as chelo missed a crucial kill in a B defense. At least the AWP didn't land in Liquid's hands in the end. 13-6 to Complexity on Vertigo yesterday, and Falcons look to punish VP by picking it into them. Virtus.pro now face Falcons, who they lost to at BB Dacha. David ""n0rb3r7"" Danielyan was withdrawn in his pre-game interview as VP still struggle to merge the style of Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov and what was there before. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken apparently took some inspiration from FURIA on Nuke. The map will see play again after FURIA picked it despite the loss in their first matchup in the play-in. On the other side, though, Twistzz opted for a different pick: Dust2 instead of Anubis. Mirage to decide like last time. FURIA were no match for Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut and company yesterday as they won a combined five rounds over two maps. This time, they're going up against Liquid, whom they've already faced once before at the tournament just four days ago. The first time around, the Brazilians came within touching distance of the win only to see it slip. Can they take their revenge today? Welcome to our live coverage of the third day of IEM Cologne's group stage. After Natus Vincere and SAW made it to the LANXESS Arena yesterday, there are two more playoffs spots up for grabs today, sandwiched in the middle of a load of elimination matches. It kicks off with Group B's lower bracket matches, one featuring Virtus.pro and Falcons and the other a rematch from the play-in between Liquid and FURIA.",12-8-2024 23:15,1723497300000

G2 march into LANXESS after battering paiN,https://www.hltv.org/news/39610/g2-march-into-lanxess-after-battering-pain,"An indomitable lower bracket run has given the 2023 champions a chance to defend their crown. G2 are through to the playoffs of IEM Cologne after a resounding victory over paiN in the lower bracket final of Group A, giving the Brazilian team no chance in an entirely one-sided series (13-6 Nuke, 13-1 Mirage). The defending Cologne champions arrived in Germany in a purple patch of form with their new additions, securing a runners-up finish at Esports World Cup and making a successful campaign through BLAST Fall Groups in a defiant show of firepower and ability to slot Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa into anchor roles. That momentum came to a grinding halt in G2's group stage opener as they were torn apart by SAW in a 0-2 defeat, resulting in an early trip to a brutal lower bracket and an early match against Spirit, who also stumbled in their opening game. Since then, however, G2 have looked almost unstoppable: Barring a comeback by Astralis on Mirage, the European combine steamrolled their opponents with entirely one-sided victories, tallying three 13-1, two 13-3, and one 13-6 map win in a terrifying run through the lower bracket. G2's stats in the lower bracket: Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač and malbsMd have looked fearsome in that run, the latter seemingly not missing a beat despite his role changes, while Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač has turned around a dismal period of form and even recorded his highest-rated map in Counter-Strike 2 against Spirit. NiKo praised malbsMd's aim in a post-match interview, saying he had ""never seen a guy with such aim,"" and that stood true in this series as malbsMd ripped paiN apart. Clip: G2 react to m0NESY's knife on kauez in final pistol round His entries left the Brazilian team no room to maneuver at all, and huNter-, Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov, and NiKo stepped up around him to ensure this was a one-sided battering in which Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt's side were completely outclassed. G2 were having fun with it by the end, with Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski grabbing a knife kill on a defusing João ""snow"" Vinicius and m0NESY adding insult to injury in the final pistol round, knifing Kaue ""kauez"" Kaschuk despite malbsMd laughingly saying, ""don't troll!""",13-8-2024 18:15,1723565700000
NAVI punch ticket to IEM Cologne semi-finals over SAW,https://www.hltv.org/news/39612/navi-punch-ticket-to-iem-cologne-semi-finals-over-saw,"B1ad3's men ended SAW's reign of terror in the Group A upper bracket to secure a spot in the semis. Natus Vincere came back from a 0-1 deficit in the series after losing SAW's Nuke pick to win 2-1 on Ancient and Inferno. The victory secures Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and his men's passage straight to the IEM Cologne semi-finals, while SAW will start their playoff run in the quarters. ""We were a bit sleepy in the first map, we didn't communicate right,"" Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov said in the broadcast's post-match interview. ""In the second map we woke up,"" he added with a smile. ""Did you see?"" SAW's confidence was high going into the opening map of the series, Nuke, as they came from beating G2 and The MongolZ on it in their two first Group A upper bracket victories. A sleepy Natus Vincere were the perfect target for the Portuguese squad. Without the pressure of the previous matches, they once again showed their prowess on the map with a fantastic eight rounds on the T side despite not winning the pistols. The early boom was in large part thanks to a clutch by João ""story"" Vieira in the sixth round that put Natus Vincere in a complicated situation. Any thoughts of a sweep were swiftly put to bed on Ancient, Natus Vincere's pick. A wild 4-2 start ended when Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy won a massive 1vs4 clutch on the attack to get his team ahead and break the Portuguese side's back. Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes and company not only didn't recover, but they didn't post another round as Natus Vincere took it 13-2. The classic of classics decided it: Inferno. SAW and Natus Vincere were neck-and-neck in the first half, with Aleksib and company leading by only two at the half before going on the attack. In the end, that two round buffer proved to be plenty as Natus Vincere went on a tear and closed out the map 16-3 to claim their spot in the semis. w0nderful, who had not been as sharp as usual in the first rounds of the tournament, was back to his best and only trailed b1t in the box score as the two topped the charts with impressive 1.43 and 1.42 ratings in the series.",13-8-2024 19:05,1723568700000
"zonic: ""We can’t keep underperforming without something changing""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39611/zonic-we-cant-keep-underperforming-without-something-changing,"The Danish coach hasn't ruled out changes as Falcons continue to falter. Falcons were eliminated from IEM Cologne by FaZe in the Group A lower bracket, bringing an end to a somewhat better but still largely dismal campaign in Germany. Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's side once again made repeated mistakes in their games and the players looked like a shadow of their best selves. ""It’s better than where we come from,"" Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen said of the result in an interview with Dust2.dk. ""Yes, we’re getting better and better, but it’s simply going too slowly. With the ambitions that the Falcons have and what I am tasked with leading, we’re not managing to close out games and minimize our mistakes. ""Of course, mistakes happen; that’s always the case. But sometimes we make too big mistakes, and there’s just no excuse for it because we’ve been together for a while now."" The team has fumbled since forming at the turn of the year, an early playoff trip at IEM Katowice and a runners-up finish at ESL Challenger Jönköping being the sole beacons of light in an otherwise dismal nine months that the players would likely want to forget. The Saudi organization was hamstrung when building its new lineup after Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač pulled out in the eleventh-hour and although it acquired the core of ENCE, who were second in the world at the time, it has failed to attain titles or stabilize as a top team. Now, four months after removing Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas and adding Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen, zonic has indicated that further changes could be on the horizon as the team continues to flounder. ""It’s clear that we need to be in a position where it’s really enjoyable,"" the Danish coach said. ""Whether it’s these five or others, it’s hard to say. We’re always looking at all parameters to see where we can improve, but there are also things that mean we can’t keep underperforming without something changing. ""When you’re an international team, you have a larger pool of players and, as I said before, the Falcons have big ambitions and we’re not meeting them. There’s an understanding that it takes time to build a team, but given everything, I would have expected us to be in a different place than we are right now."" zonic added that Falcons were always looking for new talents and said that it was a part of continuously improving to avoid ending up ""like the old Virtus.pro, who stayed together for too long."" In addressing his plans for when he returned home from the event, zonic was clear: ""I need to go home and analyze the tournament, and once I’ve looked at where I think we need to improve, I’ll make a decision. It could be in-game changes, but it could also be on the player side.""",13-8-2024 19:38,1723570680000
Metizport sign L00m1; Plopski takes on the mantle of IGL,https://www.hltv.org/news/39613/metizport-sign-l00m1-plopski-takes-on-the-mantle-of-igl,"Jackinho will not renew his contract with the organization as he steps back from the game. Metizport has announced the signing of 23-year-old Lucas ""L00m1"" Haukland to round out the team, which was depleted to four players after Jack ""Jackinho"" Ström Mattsson announced he was taking a step back from Counter-Strike. The organization has now shared that their former captain will not renew his contract, which is set to expire on August 31, and will therefore not return to the team. L00m1, who had been standing in for Metizport, and even helped them qualify for the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown over the likes of Johnny Speeds and TSM, will therefore take over the big green on a permanent basis. ""Even though he’s relatively new to the scene, his impressive talent with the AWP and fresh perspective brings a lot of potential to our roster,"" Metizport's coach Ahmed ""abdi"" Abdi said. ""I believe that his hunger to prove himself, combined with our support, will lead to great things. I am looking forward to watching him grow and make a significant impact in the matches ahead."" Jackinho's departure also left the in-game leadership up for grabs, and it's Nicolas ""Plopski"" Gonzalez Zamora who will take a step forward in his career by taking over the team's captaincy. ""Taking over the IGL role is a new challenge for me as a player and something I’ve never tried before, but it’s also very exciting to see where this will take me as a player and as a team,"" Plopski said. ""Luckily, I’ve had many great IGLs and players throughout my career from whom I’ve learned a lot. I will use that experience to help my team as much as I can, together with our coach, Abdi.""

Vitality send MOUZ to IEM Cologne quarter-final against G2,https://www.hltv.org/news/39614/vitality-send-mouz-to-iem-cologne-quarter-final-against-g2,"flameZ put on a show ending the series atop the board with a 1.49 rating. Vitality won a complicated Group B upper bracket final against MOUZ and dodged a quarter-final series against the intimidating G2 in front of the crowd at the Lanxess Arena in the IEM Cologne quarter-finals. ""We want to focus on them,"" Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan said of the group stage winners' bracket finals, a weak spot in Vitality's otherwise generally strong group stage performances, ""but we're actually clueless in some sense because it's in the consciousness. ""You don't know why but you just don't play them the same, so today we decided to come in with loads of energy in the beginning and just balance it throughout the game because it didn't work in the last games and the energy is where we needed to put our focus."" Vitality had issues in this very same match in this very same venue in 2023, albeit against G2 at the time, and also failed to clinch a semi-final berth in the upper bracket winners' match at IEM Dallas earlier this year, where 9z got the best of them. ""It's a happy thing that one year ago you were on this same platform and you couldn't finish this game against G2. Now it's MOUZ and this time around you come and don't make the same mistake. You come strong and play better teams, as well, so it's something I'm very excited about. Also the Lanxess Arena... I don't know how many fans are in this stadium but everyone loves Counter-Strike. Nobody comes for one team and only cheers for one team. It's one of the best experiences I've had as a player, people are just going to cheer for Counter-Strike."" Vitality's energy was felt from the get-go as Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut aced in the pistol round to put his team ahead in what would end up being a memorable one-sided affair that kept a goose egg on the board for MOUZ all the way up to halftime — not to mention three clutches going the way of the Ts. MOUZ did what they could on the attack to not get the embarrassing 0-13 and put six on the board before Vitality put up the inevitable winning round, and Vertigo would be where they would try and fight to bring the series back. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and company looked like they were back in it and even led at the half on the attack, 7-5, but Vitality turned it around early on and even gave themselves three match points. Despite the lead and flameZ putting on a clinic, Vitality couldn't close it in regulation, but just as MOUZ's comeback had been in vain on Dust2, ZywOo and company were poised to take Vertigo in OT, 16-13, and bucked the trend of losing upper bracket finals with a 2-0 victory in the series.",13-8-2024 21:47,1723578420000
FaZe to LANXESS after outrageous 1-11 comeback over Liquid,https://www.hltv.org/news/39616/faze-to-lanxess-after-outrageous-1-11-comeback-over-liquid,"karrigan's side pulled off an almost-impossible recovery on the Mirage decider to reach the arena. FaZe have secured the final spot in the playoffs of IEM Cologne after completing one of the greatest comebacks to date in Counter-Strike 2, recovering from 1-11 and 3-12 deficits on the Mirage decider to scrape past Liquid in the Group B lower bracket final. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's side look revitalized in Cologne after a dismal few months of form, prompting questions about whether the German tournament was make-or-break for them. They edged past Liquid in their opener in a close two-map series before getting cast down to the lower bracket following a loss to Vitality, but have clawed back with wins over Falcons and a repeat victory over Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken's side, albeit in far closer fashion. karrigan spoke to the desk after the game to discuss FaZe's level coming into Cologne and what this result means, with the captain revealing that he has started micro-managing again after throwing the book out because nothing was working. ""I told the guys five days before the event that we are going to play some extra hours and we are going to throw the structure out of the boat. The way we've been playing, people are not finding the gaps, we're not winning individually, don't understand the full philosophy, we're not playing off each other, so now I'm back to micro-managing like we have a stand-in. ""It's very hard to call like that, it's mentally draining and my level is going to drop, but it has been dropped for the past few months anyway so if I can call us home getting some decent T sides, I'll do everything for us to win. We could go the the whole way, or we could go out in groups."" Liquid chose to pick Inferno instead of Mirage in the rematch, but the decision didn't pay off with David ""frozen"" Čerňanský stamping his authority in Banana on both sides of the map and karrigan remaining a step ahead of Twistzz for much of the half. Two clutch rounds that Liquid failed to convert could've had a significant impact on the outcome, but FaZe ended up running away with the win, 13-9. Nuke offered far more excitement as Liquid romped out to an early lead, only for FaZe to claw back at the end of the first half from 3-6 to 6-6. Liquid struggled to break past FaZe's CT defenses after the side swap, with frozen finding a multi-kill in all of FaZe's round wins in a throttling halt of attacks on Mini and Upper. It looked over, then, when FaZe got a 5v3 in round 22 and had the perfect Ramp stack to counter an attack, but an absurd turnaround by Liquid flipped the round on its head and kept them in the game. That round acted as a rallying cry for Twistzz's troops as they seized firm control and powered through overtime to take the win, with Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak topping the charts with 32 frags and monumental impact in the final ten rounds. Clip: Liquid win ridiculous 3v5 to kickstart Nuke comeback That momentum carried into Mirage, where Liquid looked completely unstoppable. Nothing could go right for FaZe, Justin ""jks"" Savage won a 1v3 clutch with a sick spray transfer, and Liquid were a step ahead of FaZe in every single opening in a blowout 11-1 half. Anyone would have said it was over there, and even more so after Liquid won the first gun round to reach series point, 12-3. Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants flipping off Liquid after FaZe won the pistol round showed FaZe were still in good spirits and it would have been funny to look back on after the game, yet it just didn't seem to end. Liquid failed to seize control of bombsites even once after that, a masterclass defense of A by Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard and Robin ""ropz"" Kool providing no entry while Liquid's room in Middle went to waste as their splits were ripped apart in the late round. Clip: rain & ropz shut down A despite 4v5 That ludicrous turnaround saw FaZe bring things all the way back to overtime, winning nine rounds straight with no margin for error, and there they crushed Liquid's final hopes to lock in a LANXESS Arena berth. ""This is the calmest the TeamSpeak has been for the past four or five months, when we are down 11-1, everything is so calm,"" karrigan said of the comeback after the series. ""It kind of reminds me of the magic of 2022, we were just chilling, having fun, laughing it up and suddenly it's 12-11 like, 'Oops! We're back in town boys!'""",13-8-2024 23:06,1723583160000
IEM Cologne 2024 playoffs set with SAW amongst the elite,https://www.hltv.org/news/39617/iem-cologne-2024-playoffs-set-with-saw-amongst-the-elite,"NAVI and Vitality are straight through to the semi-finals. Numbers one, three, four, five, six, and 19 in the world have come out the other side of the IEM Cologne group stage and will fight to bring home the trophy at the LANXESS Arena. Those are Natus Vincere, Vitality, G2, MOUZ, FaZe, and the surprise of the tournament, SAW. The No. 1 team in the world, Natus Vincere, are straight through to the semis after winning the Group A final against SAW. The Portuguese team were on a tear after beating G2 in the opening round and The MongolZ in the follow-up, and even went up 1-0 in the Group A upper bracket final before being brought back down to Earth in the last two maps of the series. Spirit, the second-highest-rated team, were also in Group A, but were knocked down to the lower bracket by The MongolZ in the opener and had the misfortune of facing G2, who bounced back and went on to secure the third playoff seed from the group, in the first round. Vitality made it to the semis from Group B by doing something rare for them: winning the group stage upper bracket final. MOUZ, the other finalist, now have the tough break of going into the arena against an explosive G2 side in the quarter-finals. FaZe secured the final berth in a three-map thriller against Liquid that went to overtime on two maps, and will face SAW in the playoffs. This will be a double-edged sword for a struggling team, as it could give them much-needed confidence or plummet them even further in self-doubt depending on the outcome.

"NiKo on not becoming IGL: ""I believed I could still be one of the best players in the world""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39615/niko-on-not-becoming-igl-i-believed-i-could-still-be-one-of-the-best-players-in-the-world,"The Bosnian superstar touched on his phenomenal form after G2 advanced to the playoffs of IEM Cologne. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač has weathered a slight dip in performance since the start of Counter-Strike 2, and now he's in a renaissance. The six-time top-five player in the world, considered by some as the best rifler of CS:GO, once spoke about his discomfort after the move to the new title. His performance dipped from a 1.2X average rating to 1.09 for the first three CS2 events in 2023, and increased marginally to 1.15 by IEM Chengdu. The Bosnian rifler started to find his footing at ESL Pro League Season 19, however, and pointed to the Maltese event as the turning point for his level while on the desk after G2 qualified for the playoffs in Cologne. ""I noticed that everything started to click for me during Malta EPL, from that event on I started to play better and better,"" NiKo said. From EPL on, NiKo has averaged a 1.23 rating, and ever since Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski joined the team, he has looked like his best self with 1.35, 1.26, and 1.44-rated showings at EWC, BLAST Fall Groups, and Cologne. The thought that he could return to that level was a key factor in NiKo deciding not to transition to in-game leader during the tournament break, he revealed. ""One of the reasons why I didn't take over IGL when we were making changes was that I believed in myself, that I could still be one of the best players in the world, and I saw clear progress. ""I'm happy that I made this decision in the end and hopefully... I mean, it's pretty hard to keep up this level, but as long as I see progress in myself, that's very important for me. But I hope that people understand now why I didn't take over as IGL.""",13-8-2024 23:33,1723584780000
"NEO: ""Winning like this is a huge boost""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39618/neo-winning-like-this-is-a-huge-boost,"The Polish coach shared his thoughts on a ""rollercoaster"" of a series after his team made it to the playoffs. FaZe locked up the final spot at the LANXESS Arena on Tuesday following a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Liquid in a high-octane series where they had to come back from 11-1 down on the decider map, Mirage, after letting two match points slip on Nuke. Speaking to HLTV after the match, FaZe coach Filip ""NEO"" Kubski admitted that he was ""really mad"" that his team didn't close out Nuke but said that he didn't lash out in frustration so as to not ruin the mood for the final map. Despite the hefty half-time deficit, he insisted everyone believed a comeback was possible. The victory puts FaZe on a collision course with SAW in the quarter-finals, with a semi-final clash with Vitality on the horizon. FaZe have shown in the past that they can shift into a higher gear when they get into playoff mode, and while NEO said that the competition in Cologne is strong, he stressed the impact of this victory on his team's morale. ""Winning like this is a huge boost."" NEO, a very crazy series. There was one point towards the end of Mirage where the camera was on you and you were just laughing. What is going through your head right now? It's really hard to say one thing. This game was full rollercoaster mode. Starting with Nuke, we should have won, there was a 5v3 situation that we lost. And I was actually really mad after losing Nuke because it should have been our map. But the mood was okay. It was all fine, the guys were laughing, so, like, I took a step back and didn't even say a thing. It got to Mirage and we all know how it started. It was another surprise start. One-eleven. That was a disaster of a half for us. Surprisingly, the mood was not terrible. The guys started laughing a little bit. I wasn't feeling funny at the time. But yeah, I had to accept it, I guess, and go with the flow. The funny thing was that everybody believed, you know? We feel that we have been playing really good CS. It was a small mistake on Nuke, or a huge one, actually. We won in the end, that's what matters. At half-time on Mirage, someone said, ""We only have 12 rounds to go,"" and everyone started laughing. What was the mindset heading into the first half? There was also the pistol, where broky started flipping them off and rain was laughing. Did the players really believe at the time that the comeback was possible? Or were you simply trying to get as many rounds as possible? Yeah, yeah. You always take it step by step, right? It's the first round, then the second round, then the third… It's incredible. The thing is that we all believed, I think, we could still win, even though we were down 11-1. I think the guys felt confident and also frustrated at some point even, that it had got to a score like this. So yeah, they kept winning, round by round, and Robin played an insane map. It worked out in the end. It was a much-needed performance from ropz, who has struggled recently. Here he had a key performance at a crucial moment. Yeah, for sure. He has been stepping up recently. He has had some good games this tournament. I think it's just adjustments that have to be made, and he's been doing a great job talking about stuff within our game plans and how to make him feel more comfortable in the game. It's a day-to-day work, and it's showing results. I was watching the post-match interview, and karrigan said he's back to micromanaging. What can you say about that and the changes to the system? When you get to the top, people study you. We got to a couple of finals recently and people were more aware of what we're doing, and we started changing small things. I would say things have got back to normal, finally. He's really good at in-game leading, he has done that in the past. He knows how to do it and that's when the team has played really well. He makes good calls but everyone can step up at some point and we all connect. You're now through to the playoffs. And we all know how good FaZe can be when you get into playoff mode. What kind of impact do you think that this victory can have on the team? And do you think that it can bring back some of the FaZe magic? Personally, I think we've seen some FaZe magic already, especially in this game. We've improved our game quite a lot, actually. We're playing good CS here, but I think winning like this is a huge boost. The competition is strong. NAVI is very stable, a great team. G2 has been having impressive results. And Vitality and MOUZ play really good CS, as always. So it won't be easy, but this kind of win gives us an extra boost of confidence, I guess.",14-8-2024 00:40,1723588800000

IEM Cologne groups day 4 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39607/iem-cologne-groups-day-4-as-it-happened,"Liquid 12-12  FaZe Absurd choke by Liquid, incredible play from FaZe, whatever you chalk this up to... what in the hell did we just witness? Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants must be ecstatic after flipping the bird after the second pistol round. Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas posted on Twitter after receiving a warning from ESL for breaching the tournament's communication rules. Liquid 12-11  FaZe Liquid 12-8  FaZe This is getting close, with Liquid getting just six kills in the last four rounds. Can FaZe really bring this back to OT? Surely not after that first half and how early Liquid hit map point, but these recent rounds haven't been close. Liquid 11-1  FaZe Liquid can do no wrong. They are a step ahead in every single round, and I mean EVERY single round. Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak is 5:1 in opening duels, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken is 17-4, and nothing is going FaZe's way at all. This is so over. Liquid 4-1  FaZe Liquid 2-0  FaZe Liquid 16-13  FaZe Vitality blundered three match points in regulation, but couldn't be stopped in overtime as they won four to MOUZ's one to get it over the line and secure their spot straight into the semis. Liquid 12-12  FaZe The most unlikeliest of resets after this map looked done, with Liquid barely scraping the win in round 24 after David ""frozen"" Čerňanský nearly surprised from Squeaky in a 2v4. MOUZ 12-12  Vitality MOUZ and Vitality are stuck in after 24 rounds. Vitality had three match points on the attack, but could not convert as a strong defense in the end from Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and company kept it alive and into extra rounds. Liquid 10-12  FaZe FaZe's ticket to the LANXESS looked like it had been punched, but how in the hell have Liquid pulled this off to stay in it? Liquid 9-12  FaZe Liquid 9-11  FaZe David ""frozen"" Čerňanský is having a field day in Mini, much to Liquid's dismay. The Slovakian rifler had a slow start on Nuke but has turned up on the CT side, grabbing two or more kills in all five of FaZe's round wins. Liquid 9-8  FaZe So it's going to be THAT kind of end to the map, is it? An MP9 from David ""frozen"" Čerňanský punished Liquid's A hit and gave FaZe an early recovery from a pistol loss, Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken called another hit right back to steal away a round, and now Liquid have lost control again despite an incredible Ramp entry from Keith ""NAF"" Markovic in an effort to recover a 3vs5. Liquid 6-6  FaZe MOUZ 7-5  Vitality Vitality had a dominant run early on, taking a 2-0 deficit and turning it into a 2-5 lead, but ultimately it was MOUZ who got ahead at the half after Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás won a 1vs1 to regain the lead in the 11th round before extending it to 7-5 at the switch. Liquid 6-3  FaZe Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak is having far more impact on Nuke already, pairing with Keith ""NAF"" Markovic's Ramp holds and rotational support from Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis to put Liquid ahead. FaZe got their third after hitting a perfect timing on YEKINDAR in a 3v3, but otherwise it's been a rainy day in Cedar Creek. Liquid 0-2  FaZe Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard did a crazy amount of damage while Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants did the clean-up, leading to a funny back-and-forth. Liquid 9-13  FaZe Liquid could have had a comeback there, gaining some steam off back-to-back multis from Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and a near-hero hold from Keith ""NAF"" Markovic on A. His triple kill wasn't enough to fully turn around a 3vs5, however, and FaZe cruised to a 13-9 finish in dominant fashion to go up 1-0 heading into their Nuke pick. David ""frozen"" Čerňanský posted a 23-12 K-D and was almost unstoppable in Banana, while one of Liquid's best performers in Cologne, Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak, finished bottom of the board at 6-16. MOUZ 6-13  Vitality Six rounds was all MOUZ could muster. They will now hope to shake off their bad start on Vertigo, their map pick, where they have a shot at tying up the series. MOUZ 5-12  Vitality An ace from Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut set the stage for Vitality, who also won three clutches in the half, to dominate on the attack. So much so, that they didn't drop a single round. MOUZ won the second pistol round to keep it alive, but have a steep hill to climb before they'll even have a shot at bringing this one back. Liquid 7-11  FaZe Liquid 6-6  FaZe Not a pretty middle of the half for Liquid: They were ripped apart by David ""frozen"" Čerňanský and Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants in defaults and early rounds, forcing a handful of saves and prompting a voice clip of Keith ""NAF"" Markovic expressing his boredom while waiting. We're back to even keel at the break, though, thanks to Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken finding a gap in the defense with back-to-back A attacks. Liquid 4-6  FaZe Liquid 4-5  FaZe It's a rematch of one of the Group B opening matches for the final spot in LANXESS Arena, and it couldn't have been a better one: A showdown between Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and his former teammates for elimination or glory, and a chance for the Canadian to claim revenge. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen got the better of Liquid in that opening game, but it was in a narrow fashion: 13-11 Mirage, 13-10 Nuke. Liquid have changed things up in this veto, though, and opted for an Inferno pick instead. Mirage still came through as the decider, making this a good veto for Liquid too, but FaZe have far more tenure and experience on their side and have warmed up as the tournament has worn on. Natus Vincere 13-6  SAW SAW had left their options open trailing by two at the half, but there was no contest in the second half as Natus Vincere's attack completely overwhelmed SAW in a 6-1 half. Natus Vincere 7-5  SAW Natus Vincere took the pistol round, but were put on the back foot against SAW's second-round buy and took an early deficit. The favorites then found their footing on the CT side and regained the lead, 7-5 at the half, but just barely. There's plenty to be decided in the second half. ESL has confirmed that G2 coach Wiktor ""TaZ"" Wojtas received a warning during the elimination series against paiN after breaching the tournament's communication rules. While the first half was underway, the Polish coach was seen pointing at what appeared to be a strat sheet at the end of a round. 'We can confirm we are aware of the situation and can confirm that Taz received a warning as per our rulebook during the game vs paiN Gaming,"" ESL told HLTV and Dust2 Brasil in a statement. According to the ESL Pro Tour rulebook, coaches ""are not allowed to communicate in any other way including, but not limited to, shouting or non-verbal communication (e.g. touching) with players outside of the specified time windows."" The warning will stay in place for the remainder of the tournament. If TaZ is found in violation of the same rule again, he ""will be ejected from the game and forfeits his right to coach for the remainder of the match,"" per the rulebook. Natus Vincere 13-2  SAW Natus Vincere's speedrun of Ancient, where they quickly dispatched of SAW 13-2, has come to an end, but not before Mihai ""iM"" Ivan threw in a little extra with a knife kill on Ricardo ""roman"" Oliveira to add to his team's momentum as they head into the series' Inferno decider. Natus Vincere 10-2  SAW Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy has been the X factor for Natus Vincere on Ancient, coming in big with clutches in the most important moments. His second now comes in an afterplant situation on the A site, where he won a 1vs2 to get his team to double digits at the half. Natus Vincere 6-2  SAW The map went back-and-forth four times since the start of Ancient by the time it was 4-2 for Natus Vincere. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and company are fighting to get back into series after dropping Nuke, but SAW are doing their best to stay in it from the start to try and find their footing on the CT side. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy finally put his foot down and won a massive 1vs4 to put his team in the driver's seat as they continue to put ground between themselves and their Portuguese by following up the clutch with a clean anti-eco to lead by four. G2 12-1  paiN G2 5-1  paiN It's insult to injury as Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski keeps G2 well in control of Mirage, sitting with the knife on the smoked bomb. Natus Vincere 9-13  SAW It got scary in the end, but SAW just about held on to take the lead in the series on their pick. Natus Vincere started playing way too late and gave themselves no breathing room, with a fumbled 4v2 situation the final nail in their coffin. Natus Vincere 7-12  SAW Natus Vincere are hanging on by a thread, and they need a further five rounds to win to force overtime. Natus Vincere 3-7  SAW Natus Vincere 2-4  SAW Natus Vincere 2-3  SAW Just five rounds have been played so far, but SAW have taken the lead despite losing the pistol. Natus Vincere might not have it easy this time around. G2 7-1  paiN Lucas ""nqz"" Soares's 1v2 clutch remains the only round the Brazilians have won on the Terrorist side of Nuke, as G2 have won every other round convincingly, shutting down paiN's approaches before they even reach the bombsite. NiKo to BanKs on G2's run so far: ""I think we are on fire right now individually. We have now this capability of shutting out opponents and just smashing them because we are all very good individually."" On paiN: ""Maybe people think they are a bit worse than those two, but for us we're gonna approach them the same way we did Spirit and Astralis. They're hungry, they exceeded the expectations a bit, so we never know how they will react, but it's important that we treat them like we treated the last two opponents."" FaZe 13-6  Falcons That Five-Seven round was the turning point, FaZe didn't lose a single one after that. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company will face off against Liquid for a playoff spot, while Falcons exit the tournament. FaZe 8-6  Falcons ""Despicable,"" says Hugo ""Hugo"" Byron. FaZe bullshit in full swing, and they are back in control after a back-and-forth map so far. Liquid close it with another huge run late, this time a 10-1 including the end of the first half and a flawless one on the T side. After getting that ace, Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak seemed to have gotten his confidence back and started to go for plays and returns to the top of the board for his team despite the rough start to the series on Ancient. It's the end of the road for Complexity, while Liquid might just get another shot at FaZe, who are leading Falcons in the other Group B game right now. FaZe 1-2  Falcons FaZe have won the first gun round with the help of Robin ""ropz"" Kool's 1v3, and Falcons' money is far from ideal in the next. FaZe 0-1  Falcons Complexity 4-5  Liquid And Liquid grab a lead on the CT side. Complexity 4-3  Liquid The game is heating up with Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski getting three openings around middle as Liquid tried to aggress down there, and Michael ""Grim"" Wince following it up with a 1v3 clutch, isolating the fights as he danced around the pillar. Complexity 2-2  Liquid Liquid have gone for this MP9 halfbuy a few times now and have been making it work. This time Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken finishes off the final 1v2 to put his team on he board with the less-than-ideal round three buy. Complexity 2-0  Liquid Two rounds in a row Ricky ""floppy"" Kemery turned at the last second to catch a sneaky Liquid player trying to make a play. Complexity survive the scary anti-eco for another early lead. FaZe 16-13  Falcons All they needed was Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard to start fragging again. The Norwegian found five kills across the overtime and helped FaZe put together a 4-1 streak to take the lead after Falcons' pick. Next up is FaZe's choice of Ancient. FaZe 15-13  Falcons It didn't end up making a difference, but FaZe have two more map points on Dust2. FaZe 12-12  Falcons That Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants clutch gave FaZe enough momentum to get to 12-9, but Falcons once again brought it back with a spirited comeback as Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García warmed up his AWP. Complexity 10-13  Liquid A final push saw Liquid win eight out of nine rounds and got them the victory on their Ancient pick. That Justin ""jks"" Savage 1v2 proved to be the turning point, as from there Liquid controlled the rest of the half. Another big early lead squandered by Complexity, who led 6-2 and 5-0 against MOUZ yesterday only to lose both maps. Complexity 10-8  Liquid It's back and forth as Complexity make a halfbuy fake work wonders but then cannot convert a 2v2 on B, with a Justin ""jks"" Savage spraydown making the difference. Clip: Complexity pull off a fake with pistols Clip: jks responds with a 1v2 spraydown FaZe 9-8  Falcons Complexity 9-7  Liquid Consecutive triples from Mareks ""YEKINDAR"" Gaļinskis are keeping Liquid in the map. His solo defense of B gave way to a 2v4 retake on A, a bit of a blunder from Complexity who didn't have anyone set up to trade. Complexity 7-5  Liquid Keith ""NAF"" Markovic and Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken put in a crucial multi-kill each and Justin ""jks"" Savage clutched a 1v1 and got some crucial impact kills to help Liquid get to five at the half, making up for a rather quiet Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak so far. Complexity took advantage of that at the beginning of the half and also closed it out with two in a row, stacking A in the final round 4v5 to edge the half in their favor. FaZe 8-4  Falcons It looked terrible at the start, but Falcons got their T-side together and were competitive in the final few rounds. Their B attacks proved especially potent, with Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer selling FaZe a dream with an impressive Long fake in the final round. FaZe 6-0  Falcons FaZe 5-0  Falcons That statline tell a lot about how the start of Dust2 is going. Three Falcons members are still yet to frag, while the FaZe side is firing on all cylinders. Complexity 3-1  Liquid Liquid didn't get away with a strong start despite their pistol win and getting the anti-force round down to a 4v3 on the B bombsite. There's not a lot of faith in Falcons and Complexity as they head into uphill matchups against the fan favorites of FaZe and Liquid. Here are the results of the poll: FaZe - 52% Liquid - 38% Falcons - 6% Complexity - 4% With the two teams featuring five North American players combined, it's a bit of a stretch to call Liquid vs. Complexity the NA derby, but I suppose the region needs all the representation it can get these days. Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and company head into the matchup as favorites considering their solid track record so far with Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak and Justin ""jks"" Savage, but Complexity seem to be building their shaken confidence back at the tournament. That has been in no small part thanks to Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski, who has almost single-handedly made Complexity competitive with a 1.27 rating across the play-in and group stage. The veteran will however not be the best player on the server today judging by the form of Liquid's new awper, ultimate, sitting on a 1.34 rating in nine maps so far. On loss to Vitality in pre-match comment to sjokz: ""A couple of rounds and we could have been in the Cathedral already."" On general form: ""We've been struggling a but, but we're close to the top. We've stepped up a little bit yesterday and hopefully we're gonna have more of that today."" On the change in playstyle: ""It's like going back to the old FaZe days. Once you get to the top oeople study you, and you need to start cooking up a bit, but you don't want to overcook."" Spirit are in trouble, while SAW and Natus Vincere are loving life. Disagree with anything on the list? Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer has been in a rotten run of form ever since the release of CS2, with his highest-rated event in the new game being a 0.95 at BetBoom Dacha Belgrade 2024, where his team made the semi-final. You need to go even further back to find his last 1+ rated event, IEM Dallas 2023, where he lifted the trophy with ENCE. In the Cologne group stage, however, the Danish tactician is leading the way for his team with a 1.07 rating and was especially impressive in yesterday's win against Virtus.pro, where he averaged a 1.20. Falcons face FaZe for elimination in the first round of games today, with the European combine also having a struggling Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen on the server (he is averaging a 0.78 rating in Cologne so far), so Snappi's form might just give Falcons the edge. Falcons' stats in the group stage: IEM Cologne's group stage has reached its final day. Two tickets to the playoffs are left up for grabs, one in each group. G2 and paiN will fight it out for a spot in LANXESS Arena in Group A, while in Group B four teams are still in the running — Falcons, FaZe, Liquid and Complexity — with two series wins separating them from a place on the quarter-finals. Meanwhile, two seeding games for a place in the semi-finals will be played between the four teams who have already secured their place in the playoffs: Natus Vincere vs. SAW and MOUZ vs. Vitality. Here's the full schedule of the day:",13-8-2024 22:30,1723581000000
"NiKo: ""We will definitely be tested more in playoffs""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39620/niko-we-will-definitely-be-tested-more-in-playoffs,"NiKo is not getting carried away with the sublime form G2 showed to storm to an IEM Cologne playoff berth. G2 have been revitalized since the additions of Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski, kicking their season off with a run to the final of Esports World Cup, breezing through BLAST Fall Groups, and now making the playoffs of IEM Cologne. During this run, they have racked up a 19-7 map record. After opening their campaign in Germany with a shock defeat at the hands of SAW, G2 came roaring back with a vengeance, battering world No. 2 Spirit, handily dispatching Astralis, and walking over paiN to secure a playoff berth. In all bar one map, G2 limited their opposition to six rounds or less. Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač has been a key component of G2's resurgent showing in Cologne, such that he now sits atop the rating leaderboard for the tournament, sporting a 1.44 rating over nine maps. With a quarter-final bout against MOUZ on the horizon, NiKo sat down with HLTV to discuss G2's potential route to the final, their recent rivalry with Natus Vincere, and how the new signings have revitalized the team. You are through to the playoffs, but you have a very difficult route to the trophy. You are now facing MOUZ, then if you win that match you will face NAVI. What are your opinions on your chances? We definitely have tough opponents. Obviously you can't expect to have easy opponents in the playoffs, right? So it doesn't really matter, we are confident. We just have to do what we did in the group stage, and with MOUZ I think we have the upper hand to be honest, I think we will be favorites in that matchup. When it comes to NAVI, maybe it's a good thing we will be facing them in the semi-finals and not the final, maybe it will change something. They are definitely the hardest opponent for us, but we have to beat them at some point, so hopefully it will be this time. It has only been a couple of months since you brought in Snax and malbsMd. How do you think they are getting on with the team, and did you think that things would be this smooth right away? Things are great obviously, we are playing great and the results are there. Did I think it was going to be like this? Probably not. I don't think we are necessarily playing this good only because we brought them in, but the combination of having malbsMd's firepower and then me and huNter stepping up at the same time, I think those are the key reasons why we are smashing some opponents. Overall they brought a lot to our team, both Snax and malbsMd, and I just feel like we are having a really good time together on the server. We are enjoying playing together, we have a couple of things always ready, and we are not trying to complicate too much. Things are very smooth right now and hopefully we can build up on this and become even better. When malbsMd was brought in, there were some questions about roles. Do you think people were making it a bigger deal than it actually is? People will always talk shit, especially if they don't like the move, everyone jumps on the train and wants to hate as soon as possible. You just have to do your job and then win a couple of games, maybe an event, and they will shut up. That's pretty normal, the same happened when we brought Stewie2K in as a stand-in, everyone was talking shit and no one believed, we went out there and we won. No one said that they were wrong, but whatever. That is pretty normal in our community I would say. You've had some very good games here in Cologne. Looking at the opposition, you faced SAW, you faced a Spirit in crisis, you faced Astralis and now paiN. Are you worried that you haven't faced a top ten team besides Spirit, a team that can give you a proper test? Definitely we will be tested, this will not go on all the time. We have obviously faced top ten teams, but I don't think it's any more them having a bad day, I think it's more us actually being very strong. I don't think it can be a coincidence it happens three days in a row, right? We will definitely be tested more in playoffs, hopefully not (laughs), but we are ready and we are talking about it all the time. I mentioned yesterday on the desk that the loss to Astralis was super important for us, there was a lot to take away from that game. We are ready, as I said we keep talking about it, if things go wrong how do we react to it, so we are ready. You mentioned yesterday on the broadcast that you decided not to become an IGL because you still think that you are an elite-level player. Can you walk me through that period, after you decided to move away from HooXi. Was it something you considered during that time? No, honestly it never crossed my mind. I was asked but from the very beginning I said that I didn't want to be IGL, it was very clear for me the way I want to continue my career, it was not the right time. As I said, I saw progress in my game, I knew what I could do, and I'm just very happy that it's showing right now. If you beat MOUZ, you are going to face NAVI. Are you looking forward to the chance to get back at them for what happened as Esports World Cup? Yeah, but it's one game at a time, MOUZ is a very important game for us. With NAVI it's not just the Riyadh match, there have been a couple of games we have lost to them that have been super important, at the Major for example. They can't keep beating us forever, it's going to stop. As I said it's tough, I think they're definitely playing the best Counter-Strike right now in the scene, they have the best structure and their players are stepping up as well, it's always someone else who is playing very well. They are a hard team to beat. We were very close a couple of times but we always messed up some things, so I look forward to getting another shot to play against them. If we get another shot, one thing is for sure, it's going to be a very cool game that everyone should enjoy. Do you think, looking at the bracket, that NAVI are the toughest team you can get in this tournament? Personally for us, definitely. I think if we overcome NAVI, I don't see a tougher opponent for us. What would it mean for you to win Cologne once again after doing it last year? I think it would be cool, I don't have too many of those prestigious trophies so I really want to start winning those. It would be very cool to win another one.",14-8-2024 18:30,1723653000000

"apEX: ""My dream is to win at least one Katowice or Cologne and one more Major before I retire""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39626/apex-my-dream-is-to-win-at-least-one-katowice-or-cologne-and-one-more-major-before-i-retire,"apEX feels his team are ""on a good path"" as they gear up for their IEM Cologne playoff campaign. Vitality have struggled so far this year to recapture the heights of 2023, making finals and consistently performing to a high level, but failing to win a trophy. Their performance in IEM Cologne's group stage suggests Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's men might be getting back to their best. The Franco-Israeli side battered FURIA in promising fashion to kick off their campaign, showed real fortitude to battle past FaZe, and confidently dispatched MOUZ to seal a playoff spot. With a place in the semi-finals on the horizon, apEX spoke to HLTV to give his thoughts on Vitality's performance thus far in Germany, discuss some of his team's potential future opponents, and talk about just how much a win in Cologne would mean for his career. apEX, you are through to the semi-finals. You had some good performances in the group stage, three victories with only one map dropped, are you happy with the way the team has been playing here? Yeah, I think that we improved from the last tournament and that's what matters. I think we had really good preparation before Saudi Arabia, unfortunately in the week I knew that EWC would be a bit random for us, because you never know how much you prepared at the beginning of the season. Now it starts to pay off, that preparation. and I'm pretty proud. I think that overall we played some good CS but we can improve a lot, it wasn't as easy as G2 did. We still had an easy game first against FURIA, a bit of a tougher one against FaZe, and I felt yesterday against MOUZ, even though the second map was close, we always had control. So yeah, I think we played some good CS, but now the most important part is coming. You wrote that you ""used to never win those types of no important games,"" the upper bracket finals. That's how you lost, for example, to 9z in Dallas. What changed for you? We lost to 9z, I lost to HEROIC in Katowice 2023, I lost to G2 in Cologne in 2023. We just always had, in some way, the wrong mentality, because we felt it was okay if we lose because we were still in the tournament. These non-elimination games have always been our nightmare, so we all put the finger on it just to say, 'Guys, it would be awesome to be able to go straight to the semis this time and to give our best.' Of course winning would be the best, but just at least to feel on the server we gave our best, and that's what happened yesterday. We really wanted it so much, and at the end we won. I'm really happy about that because it's always good for the mentality and for your expectations. mezii and flameZ have said that the team came into the tournament with a lot of energy. Has that been the secret for you? Yeah. We know that Vitality is a team that needs energy to perform, because the problem is we have four players who are a bit down, I would say, and me that is pumping up the team. So I'm a bit alone in that regard. Everyone knows that now they have to give a bit more in terms of energy than what their personality is in some ways, so yeah I think we have some energy. We all know that after this tournament we have a week off because it's been draining since the beginning of July, we already had a month and a half and we haven't been home that much in the past couple of months. So for us it's just a few days more to give our best and try to get that trophy, then I think some time off. How do you look back at last season? Do you think it was a little bit of a disappointment not to lift a trophy, even though you made a couple of finals? Well of course it's disappointing, because when you are Vitality and you did such a 2023, when you have the best player in the world of 2023 and so many other years, you can't not win a trophy. The only thing is that I don't think the first part of the season was bad either. We had five tournaments, a group stage exit in Katowice that of course was really bad, but then two semis and two finals, that wasn't bad either. So I was a bit in-between when we had the summer break, but we need trophies, that's for sure. I think if we get two, three trophies by the end of the year, we will all be happy. If FaZe beats SAW in the quarter-finals, they are going to face you again. The group stage match was very close between you, what are your expectations if you happen to come across them once again? They tend to kick into a higher gear once they get into the playoffs. I think it's going to be fun to be honest, playing against FaZe in big arenas is always fun, I always enjoy it. I know they are not in the best form right now in general, but I know they can also pop off at any moment and the confidence can come back at any moment. I know it's going to be a tough one no matter what, but I know what we are capable of and I know we can beat them as well, so for us it's just focusing on that. I'm pretty sure we can beat them again and get to the final. Many are looking at NAVI as the main favorites for the title. You haven't faced them all year. What is your opinion about their playstyle, and do you see them as the biggest threat? NAVI have been playing really well since the beginning of the year, they improved so much in so many aspects. We used to play them last year and beat them most of the time, but now they are the best team in the world and playing the best CS. I think the B1ad3 system is finally there, I always know that it takes some time for him to make it happen. What I really like about their team is I feel like they have no superstars, but they play really well for each other, that's what I see from them. So yeah, I think they are the favorites and they most likely are playing the best CS as well. You've been to this tournament many times before, making a couple of finals, but you have not yet lifted this trophy. What would it mean to you to finally get this trophy under your belt? It would mean a lot, I really want at least to get a Katowice or Cologne. I had way more chances in Cologne than Katowice, but yeah it would mean a lot for me, to my career, to everything. My dream is to win at least one Katowice or Cologne and one more Major before I retire, so we're on a good path and we know that if everyone pops off it can be really dangerous. So hopefully we get this one and I will be the happiest man in the world.",15-8-2024 19:35,1723743300000
"ropz: ""People look at me like I'm s1mple, ZywOo, or donk, but I'm not""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39622/ropz-people-look-at-me-like-im-s1mple-zywoo-or-donk-but-im-not,"""I never asked to be a star player, I'm just a guy who is fine being a stable rock for the team,"" added the Estonian. FaZe have been in a slump ever since Vitality ended their grand-final streak at ESL Pro League Season 19 in the top-eight stage, and early exits at the Esports World Cup and BLAST Premier Fall Groups 2024 have done little to change the narrative. Their lacklustre form meant the team led by Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen came into Cologne with an outside chance for the title, but no one considered them the main favorites. Despite that, FaZe have shown improved form in Cologne and beat Falcons and Liquid to make the playoffs, with their second victory against Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and company containing a historic 1-11 comeback. Robin ""ropz"" Kool, whose team will face off against SAW in the quarter-finals, spoke to HLTV ahead of the playoffs and talked about FaZe's road to the top-six, his individual form, and the general state of CS2. ropz, you are through to the playoffs after a very close and hectic series. What went through your head during that game? It's hard to say, there were a lot of different things. The end of Nuke against Liquid was tough, we all felt like we should have won, and the match could have ended 2-0. But we've learned from our past mistakes, we've had many rough losses in the past few tournaments. The one thing we can take away is that we are staying more positive after each loss, and that's helping us. We found a way to reset for Mirage, even though it didn't look like that on paper, but we went into Mirage with positive vibes. We didn't have a great start there, that's for sure, but we remained calm. You saw it after the pistol round, we were all happy and showing it, so I think that's a nice development and something that took us over the line. The comms and everything, they were calm, almost too calm for FaZe, I would say, because it's quite hectic sometimes. And throughout the whole CT side, it felt like they were just pressured to close it out, and we were just waiting for them to make the mistakes. You are now going to face SAW. If you beat them, you will match up with Vitality in the semifinals. Are you confident about your playoff chances in Cologne? We are very confident. Even in the match against Vitality, we could have won 2-0 after we took them to overtime on Dust2. I felt like we had a chance there to close it out. The rounds on Anubis against Vitality were really close, a couple of clutches there, which they won. So far, we have had very promising results here in Cologne, and we'll just see how the playoffs go. If we get activated in the playoffs like we usually did in the past, we are definitely aiming for a trophy. You had a very good performance on the last map yesterday, and we have seen some more stability coming out of you in this tournament. What can you say about your slump and how you've been dealing with that? I mean, it's just a regular slump. People look at me like I'm s1mple, ZywOo, or donk, but I'm not one of them, definitely not. I never said I am, and I never asked to be a star player. I'm just a guy who is fine to be a stable rock for the team and provides consistency when it matters. And to get a performance like that when the team needed you most, would you say that it is a confidence boost for you? For sure. Closing out Mirage like that and getting some impact rounds in the comeback felt good. And with each round that went on, I felt like I was getting more into the game and just feeling it more and more. So that was definitely nice. After the match, karrigan said that he's back to micromanaging. What can you say about the impact that this had on the team's game? And does this suit you better? It's tough to say if it suits us better. Obviously, it comes down to the scenario we find ourselves in. It is a way that karrigan calls sometimes, he used to do it in MOUZ, and he used to do it with stand-ins in FaZe. When things are not so set in stone, we have to play more structured to get the trades going, because I think trading has been a big problem for our T sides. So now with karrigan just taking over a bit more, we are moving more as a pack and as a unit. I think getting those trades down is going to help us. You've been very critical about the current state of CS2, and SPUNJ said you had a list of things you wanted Valve to change. What is your opinion about the current state of the game, and do you think that this has played a role in some of your struggles in recent weeks and months? It's in a strange place right now. I'm not sure it has to do anything with my struggles, maybe a bit with motivation, but not much. I think there are many poor things happening right now. FPS issues are one of the biggest things. I am a native user, 1920, so I think you take a pretty big hit sometimes on the practice PCs. We have pretty good PCs here in ESL or IEM Cologne, and other tournaments as well, but it's just not enough for CS2. When you play on 360Hz monitors, you expect 360 FPS running all the time, but you don't really get that nowadays. You need to have the best of the best PCs to do that, and I feel like we get that in the tournament setup, but not in the practice setup, so that's where you get hurt a bit. There are some more things with CS2, definitely, MR12 and the economy are some things I will mention, and I'll leave it there. There are some smaller things, but I'll leave it there. Do you think Valve are open to discussing these things? They're improving FPS with each update, I feel like they're trying, at least, even though it has gone down from the data I've seen. FPS is something they'll always look at, you know, to improve, but I'm not sure what their opinion is. Some say humans can only see 60Hz per second or whatever, and some say more, so I don't know. I mean, the MR12 and the economy thing, it's also something that might change, or it might not, you never know with Valve. Someone might be thinking of a great solution, but maybe actually nothing is happening there, so we'll never know. You guys are now through to the playoffs. We all know how good FaZe can be when you get into playoff mode. What is the minimum goal here? Or are you guys just taking it as a bonus? That's a good question, actually. When we came into this tournament, karrigan mentioned that inside the team, we come here with no pressure. In a way, we lowered the expectations. For us, the expectation has always been to win the trophy, but here, we're just trying to show the best FaZe of recent times, at least. Make a playoff appearance at a minimum and just take it from there, and so far, we've done exactly what we wanted. Now we can think about the trophy, but coming into the tournament, we set ourselves lower goals because we needed to take a step back, and I think it has worked so far.",14-8-2024 19:36,1723656960000

QUAZAR, ranked at No. 167, then stole the first map of the best-of-three from fnatic despite a 1.43-rated showing from Matúš ""MATYS"" Šimko, but got steamrolled by a dominant fnatic on their Vertigo pick and couldn't convert an 8-5 lead on Vertigo, losing out to a strong T half from MATYS, Aurélien ""afro"" Drapier, and Benjamin ""blameF"" Bremer, the latter of whom ended the series with a 1.76 rating and 113.9 ADR. fnatic and OG join four invited teams in the closed qualifier, with two more spots to be awarded through the second open qualifier, set to begin on Sunday.

SAW fairytale continues by eliminating FaZe in LANXESS thriller,https://www.hltv.org/news/39633/saw-fairytale-continues-by-eliminating-faze-in-lanxess-thriller,"MUTiRiS and company are into the semi-finals after a historic show of resilience against arena specialists FaZe. SAW's Cinderella IEM Cologne campaign shows no signs of stopping after the Portugese squad toppled FaZe in the LANXESS Arena. A hot start on Inferno gave them a 13-6 win and 1-0 lead, but SAW had to survive heartbreak on both Anubis (where they came back from 10-4 to 11-11, only to lose 11-13) and Nuke, where they fumbled a 12-8 lead before rallying in overtime to complete the upset. Next in their warpath is Vitality, in a semi-final slated for 15:45  on August 17. Young guns Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto, Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing, and João ""story"" Vieira delivered in spades as they faced the pressure of appearing in one of Counter-Strike's most iconic stadia and emerged unscathed. The plaudits, however, have to go to in-game leader Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes, who won a game-changing 1v4 and made the calls required on T side in Nuke's overtime to get SAW over the line. In partnership with new coach Danny ""BERRY"" Krüger, the SAW playbook has come on leaps and bounds and gave the team the confidence to take FaZe on head on for their third huge upset in Germany. ""This is the greatest achievement I've ever had,"" Ricardo ""roman"" Oliveira told Oliver ""OJ Borg"" D'Anastasi on stage. ""This is better than being at the Major, this is another level."" FaZe, meanwhile, have only themselves to blame after leaving themselves too much to do down the stretch. The clutch factor they so often rely on in arenas was sometimes present, such as in a Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský 2v4 on Anubis, but it was not enough against a SAW team that had the edge in the early round. An example of that is this round on Inferno, where ewjerkz showed no respect to FaZe or fear to the crowd with a crucial quad kill. Even then, SAW could not have upset the odds in such stunning fashion without an uncharacteristic collapse from broky, who missed shots you would usually put your house on the Latviaan to hit on multiple occasions. It would be wrong to say that SAW did not feel the pressure, though. Down 10-4 after losing both pistols on their pick of Anubis, SAW put together a stunning T side comeback to get the game to 11-11. Map and series point was all but secured as SAW got themselves into a 3v2 post-plant on A, but disaster struck when MUTiRiS' Camera smoke missed and Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard successfully defused the bomb. Clip: MUTiRiS' missed smoke proves costly in the 3v2 A frozen 1v2 clutch at 12-11 secured the map for FaZe, and it looked like it was going to be the same old tale of a FaZe arena game: Close rounds, all the rounds, but ending in a beaming karrigan taking in the adoration of the thousands of fans. MUTiRiS had other ideas. Nuke was nip-and-tuck, until the first gun-round of the second half at 7-7 when SAW's in-game leader — the man who had missed the crucial smoke on Anubis — was left in a 1v4 and somehow came out victorious. Clip: MUTiRiS comes up huge with a 1v4 clutch He then doubled down with a fast A rush, winning one round off his aim and the second off his brain. A 12-8 lead was secured, four series points for SAW. But again, the pressure took its toll. Robin ""ropz"" Kool, enjoying an impactful series in the absence of frozen and broky, put a nail in the SAW coffin with a triple spraydown on Ramp as FaZe secured overtime. Clip: ropz secures overtime with a triple spraydown SAW then had to rally again, but rally they did. Two T rounds were secured to make it 14-12, leaving FaZe having to come back once again, but at 15-14, SAW's sixth match point, the Portugese squad converted a fitting MUTiRiS double-kill to march on to the semi-finals.",16-8-2024 19:34,1723829640000
"arrozdoce: ""MUTiRiS' clutch brought us back and won us the game""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39635/arrozdoce-mutiris-clutch-brought-us-back-and-won-us-the-game,"""We'll have to pray that ZywOo doesn't play well tomorrow,"" the young rifler said. SAW's feel-good story in Cologne continues as they move on to the semi-finals after beating FaZe in a hectic three-map series. It is the second top-10 team that SAW have beaten in this tournament after a 2-0 win over G2 in the group stage. Despite their lack of stage experience, SAW kept their composure throughout the series, even after some costly mistakes on Anubis. ""Before, there was some finger-pointing in situations like this,"" Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing told HLTV after the match. ""Since the break, it has been, like, round by round, if someone loses a round, screw it."" The final map came down to overtime, but it could have been much different if it weren't for Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes' spectacular 1v4 clutch on the lower site. arrozdoce was full of praise for his captain and acknowledged that round as a defining moment in the series. ""You can be sure it brought us back and won us the game,"" he said. A hard-fought 2-1 win against one of the best teams in the world. How are you feeling? I feel joy. We knew we could win this match. We just had to prove it. Many were thinking it would be FaZe vs Vitality in the semi-finals. What was the secret to staying calm until the end? There is no secret, we just have to believe in our game, and not be afraid to do what we normally do in practice and what we did in the group stage. As long as we are confident in our game, we can have more results like this. Inferno was their pick, yet you dominated the map completely. From the beginning, it looked like you had a good game plan and were prepared for everything they wanted to do. Yeah, we prepared Inferno, Ancient, Anubis and Dust2. We expected these four maps. We were not fully prepared for Nuke, but yeah, we thoroughly prepared the first two maps. On Anubis, you lost a 4vs2 and then a 3v2 towards the end where MUTiRiS missed a smoke. What was the team talk after that map like? Before, there was some finger-pointing in situations like this. Since the break, it has been, like, round by round, if someone loses a round, screw it, we will talk about it after the series. We had a lot of chances to close out Anubis, and so did they, but that's not something we're going to be worried about until we've returned to the practice room to fix some mistakes. MUTiRiS' clutch on Nuke changed the game, it felt like. How did you react to that clutch? You can be sure it brought us back and won us the game. I was already thinking that the round was lost, but the captain went crazy and blew them away. You were up 12-8 and then forced overtime. Many certainly expected you to collapse in overtime. How did you manage to stay so calm and collected? Our game plan was to hit A because, when preparing for the game, we saw that it was the weakest site in general. And I think we wanted to close out the game too quickly and they were prepared for us. They anti-stratted us and took the game to overtime. Since we had an extra timeout, we used it, we slowed the game down and we decided how to close it out. What was it like to play in an arena like this in front of so many people? Did you feel any pressure? Because you came out so strongly on Inferno that it looked like FaZe were the ones feeling the pressure. I can say that I was a little bit nervous before the walkout. I was afraid that I'd be nervous in the game and scared to react to certain situations. But as soon as the walkout was over and I sat down, I completely forgot about the audience and played like it was nothing. This is what I want to play for, I love being here and want to play in arenas like this more often. I could hear some noise but I didn't know who the crowd was cheering for, didn't know if it was for FaZe or us. All I knew was that when we won a round, they'd scream. That brought even more energy to the game. Next up is Vitality. What are your expectations? It's going to be a very tough game.  We'll have to pray that ZywOo doesn't play well tomorrow. How far do you think you can go? Do you think you can make it to the final? For me, ever since we showed that we are playing well against these teams, my dream has been to make it to the final. It doesn't matter if we win the trophy or not, I just want to continue to show that we are playing at a good level and deserve to be here. What kind of impact do you think this victory will have on the team? A very positive one. The same thing happened in the match against G2. By winning and showing dominance, we feel quite comfortable playing against these teams, and we want more and more.",16-8-2024 20:11,1723831860000
AMKAL transfer-list Sdaim,https://www.hltv.org/news/39636/amkal-transfer-list-sdaim,"The 19-year-old Ukrainian is out of AMKAL after just four months, just as the team is due to compete at two important tournaments. AMKAL have placed Daniil ""Sdaim"" Tupov on the transfer list following mutual consent, the organization announced on Friday. The Ukrainian had only been a part of the team for four months. He first joined the roster in April as a stand-in after Aleksei ""NickelBack"" Trofimov was placed on the bench, and was confirmed as a permanent member a month later. In those four months AMKAL most notably placed in the top eight at CCT Global Finals and won RES European Masters Fall over Monte to secure a place at the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown.

MOUZ's teamplay overcomes G2's individuals in statement arena win,https://www.hltv.org/news/39637/mouzs-teamplay-overcomes-g2s-individuals-in-statement-arena-win,"MOUZ's usual arena jitters were nowhere to be found as they ended G2's run early. MOUZ have broken their arena curse by defeating G2 in convincing 2-0 fashion. G2 came into the game red hot favorites after dominating the lower bracket of Group A, even beating world No. 2 Spirit 13-3 and 13-1. But their individuals were shut down by the superior system and teamplay of Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and Dennis ""sycrone"" Nielsen's MOUZ squad. MOUZ, with an average age of 20.9, are by far the youngest team out of the six teams consistently contending for titles in 2024 and have earned a reputation for strong studio form but coming unstuck in the arenas. In Cologne, they are trying to leave that reputation behind them and have started strongly. siuhy and company's next challenge is a squad more similar to themselves, in the form of Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy's Natus Vincere. ""We prepared a long time ago for this game,"" siuhy told the desk. ""We put in a lot of work out of the server. We wanted to win a game on stage, a lot of hard work went into this game, and it paid off."" That preparation even extended to a special facility at MOUZ's headquarters in Hamburg. ""We have some interesting options there"" explained sycrone, ""Stage lights, a tribune, different things to recreate a similar real stage scenario."" Clip: Jimpphat 1v2 strikes life into MOUZ Whatever their preparation was, it worked. G2's individuals turned up in key moments, with a Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač double on the P250 and a Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski triple on the Five-SeveN giving them two key CT rounds on Dust2 and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov ending the series on 42 frags. But in the more conventional gun rounds, siuhy had G2's number and put together a five-round streak on T side to go from 8-8 to a 13-8 win. Remarkably, MOUZ won just eight opening duels compared to G2's 14 on Dust2, but still came away with the win. The theme of siuhy's calling outdoing G2 continued on Mirage, as MOUZ lost both pistols but still secured a 7-5 T half and ended the game in another streak, this time of six CT rounds, as G2 won zero buy-v-buy rounds in the second half of either map. Clip: Snax taps away on B to win 3v5 ""They were just better,"" admitted Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač to Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere post-game. ""We were not decisive. We hesistated a lot about each other, lost some important rounds that broke our momentum."" It was also a disappointing match on a personal note, with NiKo in incredible form in groups as he took aim at a second consecutive IEM Cologne MVP but ended the quarter-final on a 0.86 rating. ""I played poorly as well, I just couldn't get into the game,"" he said. It was also a match to forget for new signing Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, who has shone for G2 in new roles but came unstuck in his first ever big stage appearance. After a strong start on T side on Dust2, he struggled on CT side on both maps and let his frustration out after being bested by Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo in a 1v1 late on Mirage. Clip: Jimpphat prompts a desk slam from malbsMd after 1v1 The story of the match, though, was MOUZ's teamplay and preparation shining through — with Anchor of the Year frontrunner Jimpphat especially impressive. ""All of G2's individuals are shining,"" sycrone said pre-game. ""But they're going up against a team today, and we're gonna push them."" Post-match, with Oliver ""OJ Borg"" D'Anastasi, Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás was asked how far MOUZ could go. The Hungarian AWPer replied simply, just pointing at the trophy down the catwalk from him. MOUZ are two wins away from making that come true.",16-8-2024 22:24,1723839840000
"torzsi: ""siuhy outplayed G2""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39638/torzsi-siuhy-outplayed-g2,"torzsi praised his in-game leader for a clinical 2-0 victory against G2. Despite a shaky group stage and a hard-hitting G2 squad against them, MOUZ came out on top in the quarter-finals to face Natus Vincere in the semi-finals. The stage fright many now associate with the young squad was nowhere to be seen as MOUZ won the game in a clean 2-0 series, spearheaded by Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo on Dust2 and then Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás on Mirage. In an interview with HLTV, the Hungarian AWPer praised his in-game leader, Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek, for the clinical victory, especially on the Terrorist side of Dust2. ""siuhy had really good calls,"" torzsi said shortly after the match. ""He outplayed G2, basically. He had really good mid-round calls to go long and also reset to B on the good rounds, and it just worked out."" He also spoke about the upcoming matchup against Natus Vincere, a rematch from the Esports World Cup semi-finals, where Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's team came out on top en route to the title. ""They play great CS,"" torzsi admitted. ""I think it will be a banger game."" Most people were writing you off in the playoffs, predicting a semi-final between G2 and NAVI. What does it feel like to beat them so convincingly in just two maps? It feels great to play well on the stage. I mean, we had already played vs G2 in Chengdu on stage, so we kind of knew what to expect, and we were also really prepared for this game. I'm just looking forward to tomorrow. You looked a little bit shaky at times during the group stage. How important was it to come here and play like this in front of such a big crowd? I think that at the end of the group stage we were a little bit shaky. So I think this game gives us a lot of confidence going into tomorrow against NAVI. I think they are a great team. This game was needed for us. Also, winning on Dust2 was really nice. We showed that the last game against Vitality was maybe an off-day. On Dust 2, you lost 14 of 22 opening duels, but it seemed that, tactically, you just outplayed them on that map. I didn't know about that, but that doesn't sound too good, to be honest, to lose that many entries, but I think siuhy had really good calls. He outplayed G2 basically. He had really good mid-round calls to go long and also reset to B on the good rounds, and it just worked out. We also did it perfectly, so it was amazing. I wanted to ask you about your Mirage pick. Did you want to punish G2 for some of the things that they did against Astralis? Was that your thinking? Not too much. Mirage is one of our best maps. We have, like, 10 wins on it or something like that. We have a really good winrate on it, and we prefer Mirage a lot. It was just a comfort pick from us. It was not about punishing them or anything. siuhy was smiling throughout the series. He seemed to be having a good time and making some very good calls. Yeah, we were having a lot of fun. I think when you are on stage you shouldn't get nervous or focus on the crowd. You have to enjoy this moment, playing on a stage. Especially here in Cologne. You don't get to play on this stage many times. I saw you hugging some people now after the match. Is it your family? Yeah, it's my family and my girlfriend. I'm just happy they can see me play in person. You're now going to face NAVI, are you looking to get some revenge for what happened at EWC? As I said before, I think they are a really good team, and we really want to beat them. They also have a Hungarian analyst, so I always like to play against them. It will be a great game. NAVI are one of the most consistent teams at the moment. They play great CS. I think it will be a banger game. You are now through to the semifinals. Considering how you played here in front of a crowd, how far do you think you can go here? Until the end of the catwalk right there in front of the trophy.",16-8-2024 22:34,1723840440000
Aurora and 9 Pandas trade r3salt and clax,https://www.hltv.org/news/39639/aurora-and-9-pandas-trade-r3salt-and-clax,"The two Russian sides have traded personnel. Aurora have announced the addition of Timur ""clax"" Sabirov from 9 Pandas, with Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov moving in the other direction. The move ends clax's 16-month stint with 9 Pandas, whilst r3salt had only been with Aurora for four months. In their announcement on X, Aurora suggested they had initiated the move, going on to state they had done so because ""it's important that every member of the team is not only an excellent player but also behaves in the most respectful manner toward both the club and their teammates."" The transfer comes as a surprise as r3salt performed well for Aurora during his short time with the team, averaging a 1.17 rating and helping the squad win Skyesports Masters 2024, all whilst Aurora maintained their place around the top 20 of the world ranking. By joining 9 Pandas r3salt will reunite with Aleksandr ""shalfey"" Marenov, with whom he played on FORZE over the course of 2023. clax averaged a 1.06 rating over the past three months as 9 Pandas' lowest-rated player. The team overall enjoyed modest success in recent months, claiming the CCT Season 2 Europe Series 3 title and qualifying for BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2. clax was also notably part of the 9 Pandas team that completed an impressive underdog run to qualify for PGL Major Copenhagen earlier this year, taking down the likes of Astralis and GamerLegion in the process.

"XTQZZZ: ""We felt that if we broke SAW's momentum, it'd be GG""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39642/xtqzzz-we-felt-that-if-we-broke-saws-momentum-itd-be-gg,"The French coach was pleased that his team stuck to the game plan against SAW. Vitality are through to the grand final of IEM Cologne 2024 after beating SAW 2-0 in dominant fashion. The international outfit was better in every department and conceded only 11 rounds across the series, with Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing admitting that his team was outplayed on both maps. Speaking to HLTV after the series, Rémy ""XTQZZZ"" Quoniam said that his team respected SAW and drew up a good game plan for the match. ""We knew they were going to be proactive,"" he said. ""They move a lot on the T and CT side, they're a bit crazy. So we felt that if we broke the momentum, it was going to be GG for us."" Almost nine months into 2024, Vitality are still chasing their first title this year. After being on the losing end of the ESL Pro League 19 and IEM Dallas finals, XTQZZZ hopes this can be his team's turn to lift a trophy. ""We will talk tonight and figure out how we want to approach the game tomorrow,"" he said. A quick 2-0 victory against SAW and you're through to the final. Are you happy with the way the team played today? Yeah, we got the job done for the semi-final. I think we respected SAW. They played very well. The plan was good. We stayed calm and focused, so I'm happy. But the job is not done yet. After watching SAW beat FaZe, what was the mindset like? What did you discuss yesterday to make sure you'd stay composed and focused and wouldn't underestimate SAW here? Just focus on the plan for how we needed to play against them. We knew they were going to be proactive. They move a lot on the T and CT side, they're a bit crazy. So we felt that if we broke the momentum, it was going to be GG for us. So that's it. Nuke was perhaps SAW's best map heading into this series, but you were in control from the beginning. It seemed like you were very well prepared. Can you walk me through the game plan for Nuke? Actually, I think they changed their T side a bit, so we were not that ready in two or three rounds. After that, we had a plan on the T side to take things slowly but surely. Just try to take advantage and chill. Can you also walk me through Dust2, where you were in control almost from the beginning? You lost the first pistol round but then took control of the game. You made it look very easy. I think the forcebuy did everything, to be honest. We smashed them on Nuke, they won the pistol and then lost to a forcebuy. So I think it helped a lot today. After that, we played default and took our time. And yeah, it was really smooth, I would say. You're now going to face the winner of MOUZ vs NAVI. What are your expectations? Which team would you rather face? You lost to MOUZ in the EPL final, and you haven't faced NAVI this year. Honestly, I expect a banger. I think it can be a good game. We would be happy to play NAVI because they are, at least for me, the best team in the world. And MOUZ, it could be the real revenge for EPL if we play against them in the grand final. No matter what, it's going to be a really good game, I think. This is going to be your third final this year, after finishing in second place in Dallas and in Malta. This is also going to be apEX's third final here in Cologne. Do you think that third time will be the charm for you guys here? laughs I hope so, honestly. I think we need to talk a bit, because when you lose two finals in a row or sometimes you feel you were pretty close, even in the semi-finals… We will talk tonight and figure out how we want to approach the game tomorrow. And if you win the tournament here, how big of a boost would it be for the rest of the season? If we win, I think we will have achieved something this year. And for the future, the RMR is in two or three months. So yeah, we need that. We have been preparing for this tournament since the break. This has been our mission, basically. And hopefully tomorrow we will win the trophy.",17-8-2024 18:45,1723913100000

Vitality roar past SAW to reach Cologne final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39641/vitality-roar-past-saw-to-reach-cologne-final,"A close start on Nuke soon segued into a stomp for Vitality in the semi-final match. The first semi-final of IEM Cologne 2024 has drawn to a close, seeing Vitality claim their place in the final over Portuguese underdogs SAW after a confident 2-0 victory. With this win, Vitality have secured their third final in 2024, offering an important opportunity considering the fact that the European side is one of the few top sides to be without a trophy throughout the year so far. Conversely for SAW, this result puts an end to the best run that Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes's men have had in a Big Event, one that saw them move past top squads G2 and FaZe while also securing their first appearance in front of a crowd of Cologne's magnitude. ""We saw what happened to FaZe yesterday, and we did not underestimate SAW,"" shared Vitality captain Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire following the team's semi-final victory. ""They have had such a strong run, but we focused on ourselves, and it paid off."" The series kicked off on SAW's pick of Nuke, where the Portuguese squad managed to stand toe-to-toe with their opponent throughout much of the first half, taking an early lead on the offense. After squandering a round by losing to pistols, SAW were soon beaten back further by a clutch from apEX, allowing Vitality to tie things up and shift the momentum in their favor. Clip: apEX ties up Nuke by clutching versus ewjerkz After turning a 3-5 deficit into a 7-5 half, Vitality continued to turn up the heat on SAW on the offense, allowing just one round to slip away as they stole away Nuke 13-6. By the time Vitality's pick of Dust2 began, the international side was fully into the swing of things, stamping out a deflated SAW throughout the T-side to bag a 10-2 half before closing out the map not long after with a 13-5 scoreline.",17-8-2024 17:47,1723909620000
Clutches power NAVI past MOUZ to Cologne final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39645/clutches-power-navi-past-mouz-to-cologne-final,"Aleksib's side reach their third consecutive grand final after extending their unbeaten streak on Mirage to 12. Natus Vincere have reached the grand final of IEM Cologne by scraping past MOUZ in an intense two-map series, where Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's side barely managed to extend their unbeaten run on Mirage to 12 courtesy of winning five out of six clutches in a 13-11 victory. The Copenhagen Major champions were favorites to take the win after a confident group stage campaign put them straight through to the semi-final, but MOUZ made them work for it in a series that could, in the end, have gone either way if not for NAVI outlasting MOUZ when the game came down to the wire. Clip: Daylight robbery as NAVI win round with USPs MOUZ's surprise Inferno pick caught Natus Vincere off-guard, Aleksib admitted on the desk after the match, but even that wasn't enough to net the German organization a win in the series. ""I don't think Inferno was a good choice for them,"" the Finnish captain said. ""I did think that they had more strengths on other maps, but to be honest they caught us off guard. We prepared way more on other maps. ""We still knew how they would approach Inferno, but after they picked it, we were really sure that they changed a lot of stuff trying to throw us off and not play the same as the last official."" Aleksib also admitted that Natus Vincere will need to level up on the T side if they want to beat Vitality in the best-of-five grand final, set to kick off on Sunday at 17:00 . Clip: b1t 3K and clutch breaks MOUZ's streak Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek's men needed to prove themselves on stage as conversations continued about their prowess in studio environments not translating under the bright lights of arenas, and they took a huge step toward that after a convincing dismantlement of G2 in the quarter-finals. They took another stride in the right direction by not crumbling on their Inferno pick despite a disastrous 1-8 start, but also showed they have a ways to go yet as they couldn't close out when it came down to the wire, and lost out in almost every clutch situation on Mirage. NAVI put up a brick wall in Banana that MOUZ struggled to break through at the start of the series, and a quiet half from Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás left the map feeling like a wash before he came alive in the second half. MOUZ were left staring down a 3-10 deficit after losing the second pistol, but they won a force-buy and clawed all the way back to force overtime after NAVI crumbled on the T side with lost 5v4s and poor late-rounds. That effort proved all for naught, however, as Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy reigned supreme in Apartments once back on the CT side to net NAVI a 16-13 win. Watch: jL and Aleksib win 2v2 for map point MOUZ showed tenacity as they shrugged off the loss and kicked into a higher gear on Mirage, giving NAVI the same treatment as they'd received on Inferno. Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman looked simply unstoppable as he ripped apart Natus Vincere's defaults for an 18-5 K-D and 152 ADR half, with NAVI's only salvation coming off the back of two clutches from Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius and one from Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov. Clip: jL insane 1HP 1v3 clutch Those lost clutches came back to haunt MOUZ in the second half, and it was here that their difficulties on stage reared their head once again. siuhy's side lost the pistol and subsequent force, but got back in the driver's seat with guns in hand to regain control, 10-7. They fumbled a crucial, easy round to USPs after b1t grabbed a crazy double kill in Middle, and despite answering back with a win of their own to hit 11, couldn't close out from there. Aleksib, who had a quiet map until this point, won back-to-back clutches to pull his team over the finish line and book a ticket to the final against Vitality.",17-8-2024 22:29,1723926540000
"B1ad3: ""We need to show a much better game if we want to beat Vitality""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39644/b1ad3-we-need-to-show-a-much-better-game-if-we-want-to-beat-vitality,"NAVI's coach was very open about his team's shortcomings versus MOUZ despite emerging victorious. Natus Vincere have continued their successful run results at IEM Cologne, making their third consecutive grand final as they secured a hard-fought victory over MOUZ in front of a packed LANXESS Arena. Although NAVI came away with a 2-0 win, it was hardly a confidence-boosting match for the world's No. 1 side. With their Terrorist sides lacking, they had to fend off a big Inferno comeback from MOUZ to win in overtime and relied heavily on their individuals' five clutches to win Mirage. As they head into their grand final affair against a red-hot Vitality squad, coach Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy admits NAVI need to step up their game to secure their third trophy of 2024 and their second in a row. ""We need to show a much better game if we want to beat Vitality,"" he said in an interview with HLTV. The veteran coach was open about Natus Vincere's mistakes versus MOUZ, highlighting hurried rounds and communication issues throughout the close series. In addition, B1ad3 shared his thoughts on MOUZ's surprising Inferno pick, capitalizing on the mistakes of opponents, and the mentality of the team as they stand just one win away from hoisting the IEM Cologne trophy. A 2-0 victory, and you're straight through to the grand final. How are you feeling? I'm feeling relieved, kind of, because it was a very tough match. We were really close to losing both maps. That's always a relief. I wanted to start with the veto. Were you surprised that they went with an Inferno pick? I was very surprised.  I didn't expect it. First of all, I don't like it when people pick Inferno. It's bad for them. Because this map is really hard to anti-strat and control everything. It's my opinion. We can also fully ignore preparation on Inferno, do our defaults, and still be in control sometimes. They had a good CT side, but I think they were a little bit lost in the mid-round when we were on the CT side. Imagine how hard it is to pick the map when you haven't picked it before in the tournament. It's very hard. It was risky but maybe they respect us a lot and that's why they picked it. I don't know. You seemed to be in control on Inferno. You were up 10-3 and then you lost that round to some pistols and an MP9. It seemed that round shifted the game in MOUZ's favor. Did you feel that you lost control of the game? I think that at that moment, we lost communication a little bit. We thought there were two B, but there were three. Maybe we were hurrying things up. I think we were hurrying things up on Inferno a lot of times, and also sometimes on T side on Mirage. It's very important to be aware of what can happen. And we use to say that, on stage, there's a loss of packages, like 5 percent loss, constantly. You need to know this before you make a move because maybe your teammate didn't hear you, or something like that. This is something we need to learn for tomorrow, for sure. MOUZ ended up taking the game to overtime. How did you manage to stay so calm and composed after regulation? And what was the message that you told the players as you went into overtime? I only say this when I see that we are shaky, lost on the map or something. When I see we are kind of afraid to lose. But I saw that the atmosphere was pretty good, kind of like a work in process, that's how we used to say, and the players were ready to execute ideas. So we didn't say anything about the mindset. We only spoke about what to change, because from Inferno OT, we changed completely. I said to change on Banana and we changed. That's all. Because we were a little bit passive. We were giving them too much vision. We were a little bit blind and I think it helped for one round. Second round, Justinas jL was in control more than before. Talking now about Mirage. Why do you think you struggled so much on the T side? You won only four rounds, and three of them were clutches. One of the problems that could have given us maybe two more rounds: we were hurrying things up. Okay? We spoke about how they played and we said, 'As soon as we have control, please don't hurry up because they are passive, they have good off-angles, it can be dangerous for us. We need to maybe use some flashes, maybe swing together, and so on.' And in MR12, it's very dangerous if you lose one or two rounds, unfortunately. In the end, you got the win. You won five clutches and an eco round on the CT side. Do you think MOUZ were feeling the pressure a little bit? For me, usually when it happens, from my experience, luck is on the side of the better team. I've been in this situation before. I think we were lucky in this situation. But the only thing that we can do is fish for mistakes, okay? The biggest part of what can happen is on their side. I think 70 percent is down to them. If they had done everything perfectly, we would not win the round. So maybe you're right, it's like pressure. The same thing happened with Liquid against FaZe, for example. I think 70 percent of the job was done by Liquid, in my opinion. You are now going to face Vitality in the final. You haven't faced them this year. What are your expectations for this match? We need to show a much better game if we want to beat Vitality. We haven't played them in a long time, I think the last time was at BLAST. I think they respect us, which is what has changed since the last time. I think they are very well prepared. I said this before the event that they are very well prepared and they are ready to win. The two best teams in the tournament will face each other, I think the better team will win, but we for sure need to step up if we want to win. We can play better, in my opinion. This is your third final in a row. Cologne is a trophy that no one on the team has won except for b1t. What would it mean to the team to win this tournament, especially as we head into the Major? It's good if we don't think about this as players. Because, let's be honest, this line-up is not like FaZe, when you open their profiles and there's like dozens of trophies. And when they lose, they're, like, 'Fuck, we could have got one more trophy.' And they've already had huge careers. But for these players, I think it's fine not to win this. We don't need to overvalue this. If we overvalue this, it can be like a zugzwang situation, when you're afraid to make a move on the map. It's very important not to think about how important the Cologne trophy is. But yeah, this place is amazing. The Cathedral.",17-8-2024 22:58,1723928280000
IEM Cologne quarter-finals day as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39631/iem-cologne-quarter-finals-day-as-it-happened,"NiKo to sjokz on the loss: ""I don't really know, honestly, they were better. Dust2 was a very weird game, I felt like we had too many bad rotations on the map, we weren't very decisive, hesitating a lot and doubting each other. They won some important rounds like the forcebuy on T side, and that broke our momentum, it was hard to come back after on CT side because our economy was not the best."" ""I played poorly as well and couldn't get into the game at all. Nothing to take away from MOUZ, we won the majority of the pistols and managed to lose kinda easy."" ZERO T side gun rounds for G2, with frustration getting to both Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov down the stretch. What a moment for MOUZ on stage! MOUZ 9-8  G2 G2's force buy gets them into the 1v1 despite it being a 3v5 at one moment, but Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo stands tall. G2 6-7  MOUZ What a drive-by that is. Train would write a sequel if they saw that from Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov. MOUZ 6-5  G2 Some misses earlier let Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov and G2 into the game, but Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás makes no mistake here. MOUZ 4-4  G2 Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek finally came undone when he called MOUZ into the A stack one round ago, and now a 5v3 has gone begging thanks to Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski from B Short. MOUZ 4-2  G2 New map, same Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek calling. MOUZ just keep finding the gap in G2's defences. G2 2-1  MOUZ G2 9-13  MOUZ G2's individuals falter against a MOUZ that — after that Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski triple — picked the right bombsite time after time. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa dominated as an entry on T but on CT, as a Long anchor, he went 6-9 and was punished repeatedly. G2 end the game winning FOURTEEN opening duels (and losing 8) but only win 9 rounds. G2 9-12  MOUZ Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski and Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, with B smoked, picked the worst possible moment for a Mid retake and MOUZ take full advantage. G2 9-10  MOUZ Wait a minute, MOUZ are winning? G2 have had all the pop offs, two low-eco wins, but in the standard gun rounds they are being seen off by the MOUZ machine and Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek's calling. G2 9-8  MOUZ G2's firepower goes deep, but it's their unlikeliest candidate who gets them onto nine. MOUZ have stood strong in the face of some of these rounds, but how many times can they rally in one match? Here's some insight from former M80 analyst Bobby ""stamina"" Eitrem. G2 8-7  MOUZ Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa got it started with an opener on his saved AK, but it's Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač's P250 that gets the round done. G2 7-5  MOUZ Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman has a 0.97 rating in stage games this year — 0.23 below his average. MOUZ need their spacetaker to wake up on T side. G2 4-2  MOUZ How MOUZ needed that from their young Finn. Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa is terrorising their defence with an 8-2 K-D and needs to be stopped; this is one way to do it. G2 1-0  MOUZ It's Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa's first true arena match, and he gets a triple in the pistol as G2 succeed on both A and B. This guy can play any role, any situation, under any level of pressure. What a signing he's proved to be already. G2 have already upset MOUZ at PGL Copenhagen and IEM Dallas, but now, with Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa and Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski, they are the favorites. Two German organizations, so there's an extra bit of spice to this one on a 'home' stage. The nightmare map pool on FACEIT when you're facing aimers like G2's. What are MOUZ cooking? siuhy to BanKs on how much G2 changed with Snax and malbsMd: ""A lot, actually. They play a much more loose style, which I think actually suits their players, now they have more firepower, obviously."" On playing on the stage: ""We're excited to play here. The main thing to do is to have fun on stage, something we need to work on and something we need to do and show up. We've done a lot of hard work behind the scenes, and now it's just about having fun and enjoying the moment."" sycrone to BanKs on battling stage jitters: ""One thing we have done recently is MOUZ built a new headquarters in Hamburg, and here we have some interesting options, stage lights, a tribune, different things to recreate a similar real stage scenario. On G2: ""They play free, a little bit as a mix, and all the individuals are shining. But they're going up against a team today, and we're gonna push them."" Speaking to OJ on stage: ""This is the greatest achievement I've ever had. This is better than being at the Major, this is another level."" ""This is our best achievement, on an arena everyone excepted us to lose. But I feel like we can do better."" Take a bow, Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto and Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing. FaZe 14-16  SAW It's happened! FaZe thought they were the heroes of this story. It was a classic FaZe tale, full of comebacks and clutches. But, for once, the procrastinators are punished. FaZe 13-15  SAW Two more match points after Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto delivers on the B bomb-site. FaZe 12-14  SAW Pressure off, and Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes finds the calls he couldn't in regulation with those match points. Two T rounds already! FaZe 12-12  SAW Four CT rounds on the bounce for FaZe to secure OT! The Robin ""ropz"" Kool renaissance has a new great work of art. FaZe 8-12  SAW A 3v5 again! Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing does everything in the lower bomb-site FaZe 8-10  SAW FaZe 7-9  SAW A 1v4 clutch and then a fast A pop call means Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes has won SAW back-to-back rounds himself. Shades of Peter ""dupreeh"" Rasmussen's cl;utch from Katowice 2017 with the one-tap on the last. Chef's kiss. But SAW cannot get ahead of themselves. Catching FaZe is one thing, passing them is another. FaZe 5-7  SAW ""All roads lead back to Ricardo ""roman"" Oliveira,"" says Harry ""JustHarry"" Russell as SAW take the lead. The veteran is up to 104.7 ADR and SAW have earned their lead. Lesser teams would have crumbled under the pressure after the heartbreak on Anbuis, but SAW have been worth every penny. FaZe 5-5  SAW SAW getting back into it? Time for a Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen double entry. FaZe 4-3  SAW If he pistol was crucial what are the first few gun rounds? FaZe have now won three out of four buy-versus-buy rounds with Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's new slower and more micro-managing style serving FaZe well. Both teams excel on T side on Nuke, remember. FaZe 0-2  SAW A nice idea from FaZe, who fake a Secret push with a smoke and two players only for three to pop out on A. But even with Hut player Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing rotating downstairs, SAW survive the fake and win their first pistol since Inferno. Robin ""ropz"" Kool delivered most of his impact (like he did on Inferno) early on in the game, and had  110.3 ADR and a 1.82 rating at the end of the first half. But those T rounds proved absolutely crucial — the only two CT gun rounds FaZe won were the 2v3 retake in round 23 and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský's 1v2 in round 24. WIthout that good start (and the Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants-led 2v4), we're looking at SAW in the semi-finals. It was a clip a round at the stretch there as classic FaZe bullshit kicked in — this Nuke decider cannot come soon enough. FaZe 13-11  SAW Noooooo SAW! All that work is for nothing. 4-10 to 11-11, just to lose 11-13. FaZe 12-11  SAW Heroics at the death! SAW miss their Camera smoke in the 3v2 post-plant on A and it costs them everything. FaZe 11-11  SAW Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto, Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen, and Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing all deliver with a 2K each but it's the young Portugese duo who come away with the round win. We're all tied up! FaZe 10-7  SAW FaZe won the second pistol but SAW have won the first two gun rounds to break Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen and company's bank. They've just been so well drilled all tournament — the Danny ""BERRY"" Krüger and Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes gameplan still has legs. FaZe 8-4  SAW SAW have kept it coming with a new active plan every CT round, but sometimes FaZe only need two alive to turn the game on it's head. They end the half with eight rounds by winning the mid and late round battle. SAW 4-4  FaZe Some strong work from Robin ""ropz"" Kool got FaZe a lead, but they are still lacking fragging out of the rest of their players. Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants in particular is continuing his poor series, in the clip below he fired off a full AWP clip and hit nothing. SAW 1-2  FaZe Robin ""ropz"" Kool has ensured the force-buy wars continue, his opening 2k allowed FaZe to rotate back to hit the A site and win the round. SAW 1-1  FaZe So indecisive from FaZe on the push into the site... SAW 0-1  FaZe SAW 13-6  FaZe A completely one-sided affair, FaZe never really looked like they were in this map. SAW's proactive CT approach had FaZe at sixes and sevens in the first half, before they cruised over the finish line with some potent work on T side, particularly by Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing. arrozdoce and Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto were imperious all game, but it must be said FaZe seemed to come into this map cold. Helvijs ""broky"" Saukants had a stinker, posting one frag in the first half, and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský was uncharacteristically shaky. SAW 10-6  FaZe Oh dear SAW... SAW 8-4  FaZe SAW have dominated their CT half on Inferno thanks to an aggressive and proactive approach. They read FaZe well and always had the right push to take away space and prepare quick flanks. FaZe had a couple of standout rounds, as shown below, but overall looked a little lacklustre. SAW 4-3  FaZe Just when SAW were taking control... SAW 4-2  FaZe SAW have now strung defensive rounds together, taking control of the half. SAW 2-2  FaZe SAW had almost nothing in that round, but Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto's saved rifle has allowed the Portuguese to tie up the score. SAW 0-1  FaZe Already a spicy pistol round to kick things off. FaZe recovered from a lost opening kill by overwhelming the A defence, but Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing nearly pulled off the clutch. A very interesting veto has come through, thanks to SAW picking Anubis instead of Nuke. If the choice pays off, we are in for a fascinating matchup. BIG might not have made it to the playoffs, but their fan group is still in the arena in full force. One of the flags the group are flying sports Fatih ""gob b"" Dayik's face and a message thanking the German for his service. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen stopped for a quick chat with Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere on the broadcast, giving his thoughts on FaZe's performances in Cologne. On playing in Cologne: It is the cathedral of CS. Over my career I have seen everything grow. Katowice and Cologne are the two events you want to win, there's prestige, there's pain, there's happiness, there's everything attached to these two tournaments. As a player for me, this is what I live for, this is what I breathe for, this is what I want to play for. Some other tournaments are not as important as this one. What karrigan wants from his team: The most important thing is I wanted the boys to come out and enjoy it. Rewatching the Liquid game kinda sets everything in perspective. When we were in the flowstate we didn't talk much, we just focused on next round, next round, next round. That's where we're dangerous, that's where we thrive the most, under the pressure and under the circumstances, and there's no other circumstances like this that can make everyone perform. On FaZe's approach: Sometimes when you're in it you can't really see it, but looking back at some games, at the Major and over the last three months, we kinda lost ourselves, how we want to play and the philosophy. So taking a step back and going back to the basics, me with more control, but if I see the confidence is right, if I see people going for duels, I can switch the philosophy mid-game. I am used to playing under different circumstances. Christopher ""MUTiRiS"" Fernandes spoke to James ""BanKs"" Banks on the broadcast ahead of SAW's match against FaZe, giving some insight into his team's mentality. On his feelings: I don't know, it's hard to find some words for what I am feeling right now. It's a dream, coming here in this big stage and arena is just special. I'm just surprised for everything, so I just want to enjoy this. On the pressure of a big stage: I think that the pressure is going to be here all the time, and it's good, we just need to use the pressure to be more hungry to win, just use the pressure to be more focused. That's what we talked about. I don't have special tips for my guys because I have never been on this stage (laughs). We just want to enjoy it together and play as a team, and I want to show good Counter-Strike to the arena, that's the most important thing. On losing to FaZe recently at BLAST: I think that we learned so much in the past months, so we are a different team now. Our map pool is better now, that's the biggest factor I think, because when you have a bad map pool you go to BO3s and are afraid of everything. On SAW's approach to the game: We just need to be ourselves, we are pretty confident but we know that FaZe on these stages are just different. We don't need to think too much about that, just focus on ourselves and give our best. Of course we are the underdogs... but we want to win. Danny ""BERRY"" Krüger is fully embracing the ""Julio"" meme, the Portuguese name that SAW's fans have started to call him by. On paper, FaZe got the dream playoff bracket. Avoid Natus Vincere until the final, and get SAW instead of G2 in the quarter-final. But that doesn't tell the whole story. SAW might have dropped off towards the end of last season but they have been revitalized in Cologne, taking down G2 in beautiful fashion to kick off their campaign before securing a playoff berth with a resilient victory over The MongolZ. FaZe meanwhile have been in sub-optimal shape for some time and whilst they have experienced some thrilling highs in Cologne, such as their epic comeback against Liquid, they have also laboured at times. These two sides met recently at BLAST Premier Spring Final, where FaZe took a 2-0 victory by virtue of stealing SAW's map pick of Ancient in overtime before battering the Portuguese squad on Inferno. SAW are, however, a different beat with time to anti-strat a specific opponent. The map pool would seem to slightly favour FaZe. SAW's perma-ban is not a great battleground for FaZe, whilst FaZe's usual ban of Vertigo is a solid battleground for SAW. SAW have picked Nuke in every series in Cologne, and the winrates suggest they should go for it again, but FaZe picked it in both series against Liquid, indicating they would be comfortable if the veto went that way. Expect to see Nuke picked by SAW, Inferno or Ancient picked by FaZe, and the final map to be the middleground of either Anubis or Dust2. Likely Dust2, as FaZe tend to remove Anubis if their opponent bans Vertigo. Before we head into the business-end of IEM Cologne, let's get a quick temperature check on the race for MVP. Currently the top seven spots for rating are all occupied by G2 and Natus Vincere players, with Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač holding a slender lead at the top. Everything can change however, with plenty of series left to be played. Who do you think will bag the HLTV MVP medal? Cologne has borne witness to many of the best moments in Counter-Strike history. Countless epic plays, era-defining victories, and heart-wrenching losses. But which one is your favourite? HLTV spoke to some of the pros competing in Germany this year to get their take on the matter. Hear from Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen, Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire, Håvard ""rain"" Nygaard and more. IEM Cologne has finally reached the playoffs, and the LANXESS Arena's doors are open for fans who made the pilgrimage to watch the two quarter-final series of the day. The early match sets up the playoff underdogs, SAW, against a struggling FaZe side who made an incredible comeback against Liquid in their group stage decider match that filled the team with confidence ahead of the tournament's final stage. The series kicks off at 15:45  and the winner will meet Vitality on Saturday in the semi-finals. On the other side of the bracket, the second match, at 19:00 , will see MOUZ and G2 clash to reach the semi-finals against the world's No. 1 team, Natus Vincere.",16-8-2024 23:00,1723842000000

IEM Cologne semi-finals day as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39640/iem-cologne-semi-finals-day-as-it-happened,"Despite the fact that both Vitality and Natus Vincere have been regular competitors in 2024's top events, the two sides have yet to face this year. The last time the black-and-yellow-clad squads faced off was almost exactly eight months ago at the BLAST Premier World Final, where Vitality bested Natus Vincere 2-0 en route to their tournament victory in Abu Dhabi. Since then, Natus Vincere have bagged two trophies, including at PGL Major Copenhagen, while Vitality have found themselves without a trophy so far this year. Who do you have taking this all-important rematch? After emerging victorious over MOUZ in a nail-biter two-map series, Natus Vincere skipper Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen shared some comments on the desk regarding the veto, his individual performance in the series, and team's comeback to close out the series on Mirage. On MOUZ's Inferno pick: ""I don't think Inferno was a good choice for them. I did think that they had more strengths on other maps, but to be honest they caught us off guard. We prepared way more on other maps. We still knew how they would approach Inferno, but after they picked it, we were really sure that they changed a lot of stuff trying to throw us off and not play the same as the last official."" On individual performance: ""It was funny. I know what my job is on the T-side, and to be honest, it was rough, a couple of bad calls as well. As soon as I got to CT-side, I feel like it's a new half for me. I'm on the bottom a lot of the time, so I can manage. There was a timeout where B1ad3 said they would test me one more time on B. They didn't, but I'm happy I got the clutch."" On Mirage comeback: ""I actually thought that we can make a comeback even to OT, because we felt so much better on CT-side compared to T-side. Usually, it's the opposite, or our T-sides are very strong in terms of, as soon as we get entries we're just all over the place. Today we had a lot of entries on Inferno, but kudos to MOUZ, they were just one step ahead on their CT-side. After we got the two last rounds on the T-side, and won the pistol, everyone understood this is our game now."" Natus Vincere 12-11  MOUZ Natus Vincere 8-10  MOUZ Natus Vincere 7-10  MOUZ Slow start to the half, but MOUZ are finding their footing with Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman cracking open B with a precision headshot against Mihai ""iM"" Ivan on Catwalk. Natus Vincere 7-8  MOUZ Natus Vincere 5-8  MOUZ Natus Vincere 4-8  MOUZ Echoes of Inferno right now as MOUZ's 8-2 lead dwindled just ahead of the break. A double entry from Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy granted Natus Vincere their third and this 1v2 clutch from Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov closed out the final round of the half after MOUZ gave away man advantages repeatedly, and now the pressure is on for MOUZ to convert. Natus Vincere 2-8  MOUZ Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius is the only reason NAVI are in this at all, their only two rounds coming from his 1v3 and this clutch, which shouldn't have been close with Mihai ""iM"" Ivan in Window. Natus Vincere 1-6  MOUZ This is all coming up MOUZ right now, with Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman racking up five multi-kill rounds and destroying Natus Vincere's mid-rounds. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás's openers are getting early advantages, and this game is starting to look like how Natus Vincere manhandled MOUZ at the start of Inferno. Natus Vincere 1-4  MOUZ A tall task ahead for MOUZ if they want to force an Ancient decider: NAVI have been indomitable on their Mirage pick, with their last loss dating back to May against HEROIC. MOUZ are no pushovers and had a 12-map winstreak on the map earlier in the year, but were dumpstered 13-5 by NAVI at Esports World Cup the last time the teams faced off. A near crumble by the reigning Major champions on the very map they dominated FaZe on in the Copenhagen final, but they got it over the line in the end. Aggression in Apartments from Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy dismantled MOUZ's defaults and let NAVI win all three CT rounds to close out the map, but at least we have a series now with MOUZ not rolling over. Natus Vincere 15-14  MOUZ Natus Vincere 13-14  MOUZ MOUZ have taken the lead for the first time on their map pick, and NAVI look completely flustered. They couldn't convert yet another 5v4 and floundered with their rotations in the late-round. Are NAVI just going to give this away? Natus Vincere 12-12  MOUZ Studio what, says MOUZ. An incredible comeback to force OT after this looked over at multiple points, and now it's a huge advantage with momentum in their favor. Natus Vincere 10-12  MOUZ Natus Vincere 11-8  MOUZ Natus Vincere 10-8  MOUZ Five straight from MOUZ, and these last few haven't been close with Natus Vincere getting only two kills across the last three rounds. Insult to injury as both were opening kills for 5v4s yet NAVI couldn't convert, and it's a two-round game now after what was a complete blowout. Natus Vincere 10-4  MOUZ Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy went full headshot machine in the second pistol round, gooshing four MOUZ players and getting two kills to bag NAVI an easy round, but they've given away the advantage after MOUZ channeled them into a B stack with a force-buy. Natus Vincere 9-3  MOUZ This must have been a hard one to watch if you're a MOUZ fan. Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek's side had a few opportunities to get into rounds early in the half, but were slaughtered upon entry to bombsites repeatedly with Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius and Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen proving immovable on B. Back-to-back openings against Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy in Apartments allowed MOUZ to add two to their tally before the break, though, so a comeback isn't out of the question once they swap to the CT side. Natus Vincere 8-1  MOUZ Natus Vincere 7-1  MOUZ Can't say I expected two batterings today, and definitely not in this fashion. MOUZ have nine kills combined, eight rounds into the game, with Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás yet to post a kill in what has been utter dominance from Natus Vincere thus far. Natus Vincere 2 -1  MOUZ A bold pick from Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek and Dennis ""sycrone"" Nielsen, completely unexpected by the desk for good reason: It is their least played map and a strong one for NAVI. The curveball is needed, though, with NAVI on an 11-map winstreak on their Mirage pick. Just ahead of his team's semi-final matchup versus Natus Vincere, MOUZ's Dorian ""xertioN"" Berman shared a few words regarding the impending series, his team's quarter-final win over G2, and his current individual focus. On the win over G2: ""I'm very proud of everyone. I think that we played super well on stage, and it's really nice to see, and we really showed our true level. I still think it was not our best, so NAVI should definitely be scared today."" On xertioN's focus for the game: ""Having fun. I think that was key for us yesterday. For me, it's just about having fun and creating the space for my teammates so they can shine. If I run through a smoke, I may look stupid, but I'm just trying to give confidence to my guys. At the end of the day, I'm just doing what is good for my team."" On the NAVI matchup: ""I think they are a similar team to us, they tend to play team CS. It's going to be about who plays better as a team today, I would say. I think individually we outmatch them on basically every role, so I am confident about our level today, but of course they are a very good team. I'm looking forward to the game, and hopefully we show our A-game today."" Shortly after Vitality's victory over SAW, coach Rémy ""XTQZZZ"" Quoniam spoke to HLTV in a brief interview. Some snippets can be found below, alongside the video of the full interview. On final matchup: ""Honestly, I expect a banger, it's going to be a close game. We will be happy to play NAVI because, for me, they are the best team in the world, and MOUZ for the revenge for EPL. No matter what, it's going to be a really good game."" On not having any event wins this year: ""I think we need to talk about it, because when you lose two finals in a row, or sometimes you feel you were pretty close even in the semi-final, we have to talk tonight and figure out how we want to approach the game tomorrow."" How a Cologne win would affect Vitality's season: ""I mean, if we win, we have something this year, and it could help for the future, especially for the Major. In two or three months is the RMR, we need that. We prepared for this tournament since after the break. We are in a mission, and hopefully tomorrow we win the trophy."" SAW star Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing spoke with HLTV after the series against Vitality and admitted that his team was outplayed in every department. The Portuguese team will have no time to rest as they will play the RMR closed qualifier, which is slated to start on August 21. ""We're not going to rest. We're going to continue to work hard,"" he said. On what went wrong: Let's just say they were the first team to fully study us. They countered everything we did on both maps. We couldn't play our game. On losing Nuke: We expected them to have studied us and to have a way to defend the A site. We tried to play a bit differently at first and then make some changes and start to lean towards A, but since we were constantly being countered and they were making good reads and winning duels, we didn't know what to do and couldn't recover. On lessons from this event: Anything is possible, we just have to want it and fight to be on these stages again and get the results we had here. Vitality 13-5  SAW After a tight start to Nuke, Vitality emerged victorious on SAW's map pick with a dominant second half, allowing them to snag the map 13-6. The international side kept up the momentum on their own selection of Dust2, taking fights with supreme confidence throughout the first half to take a 10-2 scoreline on their T-side, before closing the map out not long after on the defense. Vitality 11-3  SAW Vitality 10-2  SAW SAW seem like a shell of themselves after Nuke, offering up little resistance as Vitality has simply trampled over the Portuguese side throughout Dust2. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's men are now three rounds away from securing their place in the final of IEM Cologne. Vitality 5-1  SAW I hate to be the guy to call it early, but stick a fork in SAW, they're done. Vitality 1-1  SAW Unfortunately that hype pistol clutch means little as Vitality answered back on a force-buy with Tec-9s. SAW even got the opening kill. Vitality 13-6  SAW It all started with the loss to pistols. SAW didn't look like the same team after the blunder, losing a bit of the edge and potency that has carried them thus far in the tournament. Once Vitality got onto T side the result was never in question. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's men have been one of the best offensive teams all year, and nothing changed today. Vitality 11-5  SAW It seems SAW will be left ruing the loss to pistols in the first half. Vitality have put in a workmanlike performance since, winning their T pistol and never looking back. Vitality 5-5  SAW SAW are starting to lose control of a half they could have won by a large margin. The big issue was the fumble to pistols, sending the bomb in first only to lose it to a USP and a Deagle. The Portuguese squad then nearly managed to fend off a Lobby crunch, but Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire stayed cool in the clutch. Vitality 3-4  SAW SAW have managed to hold on to the lead, punishing some Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi aggression through Hut before hitting the A bombsite effectively. Vitality 1-3  SAW SAW are sticking to their usual T-side approach, staying grouped-up and relying on strong trading and firepower from Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto. Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan stood tall in Vitality's first proper gun round to get his team into the map. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire stopped for a chat with James ""BanKs"" Banks ahead of the upcoming semi-final bout with SAW, and the Frenchman was confident his team were ready for the task. On if they can figure out SAW: Obviously we watched demos, and we're not gonna lie, we don't have to underestimate them. They play really good, they play amazing Counter-Strike, but we know if we play our A game we're gonna beat them. It's all about bringing our A game today. Props to them for making a semi-final in Cologne, it's just amazing and I love to see it. On being ready for an underdog: Of course we are ready, when you are Vitality you have to be ready for any opponent in the semis. We are even ready to lose rounds, lose a map, the important thing at the end is winning the BO3. Ricardo ""roman"" Oliveira was full of confidence when he spoke with Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere on the broadcast, saying he feels his team can beat Vitality. On playing on stage in Cologne: Just experiencing playing here every player hopes for, so it's incredible to be here, and coming out with a win, it's incredible. We didn't have time to feel it all the way, but it's been so good for us. We just have to keep doing it. On SAW's improvement throughout the tournament: What I'm gonna say is that we've been beating really good teams, and that's a really important factor for us because it will give us a lot of confidence against tier one teams. That was something we were dealing really bad with because we could never beat those teams, and now we feel like we can beat any team in the world. On feeling about facing Vitality: This is basically the same match as against G2 and FaZe. Those teams are also on the best level, so our mentality is exactly the same. If we do our best game, we can win. SAW have made history for Portugal by going further in a prestigious tournament than any of their countrymen have gone before, and by a long margin. Fellow Iberians Movistar Riders made it to the semi-finals of IEM Cologne in 2022, but can SAW go one better when they take on Vitality later today? Movistar Riders' run in 2022: SAW's run so far in 2024: Who had the better run, should SAW's end today? Zvonimir ""Professeur"" Burazin has been out on the ground in Cologne to find out what people miss the most about CS:GO. Are you in Cologne today? Make sure you grab yourself a HLTV photobook. If you aren't in Cologne, don't worry, you can order one online. Mihai ""iM"" Ivan, Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy and Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius finished Natus Vincere's dominant group stage campaign rated in the range of 1.35 to 1.43, featuring at the top of the leaderboard. The trio from the other group-topping squad, Vitality, aren't far behind, rounding out the top 10. The semi-finals begin in just under two hours' time and we have Vitality and Natus Vincere joining the fray in the LANXESS Arena after making it directly to the semi-finals from the group stage. First, hoping to continue their Cinderella run are SAW, who will take on Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut and company first after their three-map thriller victory over FaZe yesterday. MOUZ's stage fright was nowhere to be seen yesterday as they took down a G2 squad that looked unbeatable in their lower bracket group stage run just a few days prior. They're taking on Natus Vincere in the second semi, in a rematch from the Esports World Cup semi-finals:",17-8-2024 22:30,1723926600000
Short news: Week 33,https://www.hltv.org/news/39595/short-news-week-33,"Into the Breach and Owen ""smooya"" Butterfield previously confirmed forthcoming changes to their roster, with the British player venting his frustration at an unnamed member of the team in a post-match interview. Since then, Into the Breach has played matches in Elisa Invitational Fall, YaLLa Compass Summer 2024 Contenders, and is currently competing in the second IEM Rio EU open qualifier with Karol ""rallen"" Rodowicz in place of Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas. The Pole has sat on ITB's bench since March and didn't return when the roster was rebuilt in June, but is aiding them in the interim while they finalize a replacement. Meanwhile, ITB is making jokes about the substitution, including a post saying, ""Guys, BOROS is just at the dentist!"" Mapcore's second big mapping contest, in partnership with FACEIT, has reached its second stage. The ""Big Adventures"" contest tasked community mapmakers to design an original 5vs5 bomb defusal or hostage-rescue map, with an open entry first stage allowing any creator to submit an entry that would be judged solely on ""Fun Factor (Map Design)"" and ""Originality."" Submissions for the first stage could be grayboxes (entirely untextured) or ones in creation prior to the announcement, as long as they hadn't been submitted to the Workshop. Now, the panel of judges have selected 57 maps to advance to the second stage, where map creators will have six months (until February 9, 2025) to iterate, enhance, and add texture to their initial submission before ten finalists are selected for ""The Grand Finale."" You can find the complete list of maps that advanced to stage two here. Ever wanted to know when the AWP is most useful? Or what the hardest situations are for the AWP to deal with? Who better to give the answers to these questions, and many more, than Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov The official CS2 Twitter account has taken a moment to highlight Cooper ""Trucklover86"" Phelps's impressive 1v5 Deagle play, suggesting it as a candidate for ace of the year. What do you think? You can view the clip in either the Tweet embed or the video embed below. In response to a Reddit user finding out that a team received $800 as part of their loss bonus for planting the bomb in the previous round — as opposed to $600, which is the new value following May's economy changes — ESL revealed the wrong server configuration used for the duration of the IEM Cologne quarter-finals. This also happened in the IEM Dallas group stage, which took place just a few days after the economy changes were rolled out. ""This specific settings in the config was incorrect after switching from the Group stages of the tournament to the Playoff Stage,"" ESL Senior Product Manager Michael Parsons said. ""The fault is due to human error and not a bug. We have reached out to the teams and will address the issue internally. We can confirm that this has now been fixed for the remainder of the games in the Playoff Stage."" ""The championship ended so quickly for us and I didn’t have time to say what I wanted to say on stage,"" began Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov on Twitter. ""I want to send a message to a man who inspired millions of people, including me. Sasha, we are all waiting for your return to the pro stage. It's time to turn haters into your fans once again!"" ESL released the third player profile during IEM Cologne, on MOUZ's IGL Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek, just before he played in the quarter-finals: OG has gotten their priorities in order with a busy schedule in front of them, deciding to focus on the RMR closed qualifier and BLAST Showdown. As such, the team has stated they will not be participating in the upcoming open qualifier for ESL Challenger Atlanta. North American side FLUFFY AIMERS have announced the addition of Mexican rifler Edgar ""MarKE"" Maldonado, taking the place of Vova ""bezymecc""  Slobodian on the team's active lineup. MarKE now returns to action after being on the bench of Nouns since mid-April, making way for the trialing of Anthony ""CLASIA"" Kearney before the eventual signing of William ""RUSH"" Wierzba. What a treat from Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen. As a ""one-time thing,"" the Dane has released the entirety of FaZe's communications from their incredulous comeback against Liquid, starting from 1-11 in the second half. Johnny Speeds, a team that is slowly becoming one of the best feel-good stories hailing from Sweden, is bootcamping at NIP's facilities in Stockholm. The squad was praised by Ninjas in Pyjamas's Director of Esports, Erik Wendel, who said that ""they're more organized and professional than many tier 2-3 organizations out there."" Johnny Speeds recently broke into the top 40 in HLTV's ranking as they're quickly becoming a strong contender in Sweden and Europe's second tier. They are also a top 25 team in Valve's European Ranking, which means they are set to play in the Shanghai Major Europe RMR's Closed Qualifier. ""This reminds of the old school 1.6 way of building a team and succeeding,"" Wendel concluded. ""It'll be a lot of fun to keep following their journey, I hope they manage to qualify for the RMR, stay together, and keep climbing the rankings!"" A small patch has just been released for CS2, with the most notable tweak being changes to ""tagging effects"" in order to ""reduce instances of players experiencing teleportation when taking damage."" Additionally, it seems that Valve have also introduced measures of some kind to track the utilization Snap Tap, although to what end this information is being collected remains to be seen. You can view the full patch notes of the update here. Wednesday saw the start of the first IEM Rio EU Open Qualifier, and several big names are already eliminated. Ninjas in Pyjamas are out after a loss to LEON, while ENCE were eliminated by 500. BC.Game, who are playing with Simon ""KWERTZZ"" Horák, are also out, as are GamerLegion, TSM, and Metizport. The first day of action is still underway, with the eliminated squads set to receive one more chance in the second open qualifier, set to start on August 18. You can take a look at the bracket here. Into the Breach have put out a Tweet saying that changes in their CS2 roster are imminent, confirming an earlier Tweet by Owen ""smooya"" Butterfield. The team built around the British AWPer had big expectations at the time of inception but is currently ranked at just No. 104 in the world rankings after a 50% win rate in the last three months. It is worth noting that the team utilized Qiang player Áron ""Aaron"" Homoki in lieu of Mohammad ""BOROS"" Malhas in their match versus ECLOT in YaLLa Compass Summer 2024 Contenders earlier today, where Into the Breach secured a 2-0 series victory. Christopher ""dexter"" Nong has put out a public appeal for analysts to work with FlyQuest after the team suffered poor results at IEM Cologne's Play-In, Esports World Cup, and IEM Dallas. ""I had health issues,"" Sergey ""hally"" Shavaev told the Spirit IEM Cologne vlog. ""We decided it was best for me to recover fully so I would not miss Cologne."" Plenty more tidbits in the team's vlog from their disastrous Cologne campaign. This is likely to ensure the ranking is sufficiently up-to-date to work as a meritocratic invite system, but it does create some issues in terms of visas in such a short timeline. ""I implore you, please rethink this decision,"" Complexity GM Graham ""messioso"" Pitt wrote on Twitter. ""Set the window between 16 and 12 weeks. 16 weeks allows TO's to host their events in great, global locations, where visas may be harder to plan for.""

Vitality win IEM Cologne 2024 over NAVI after nail-biting 117-round final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39650/vitality-win-iem-cologne-2024-over-navi-after-nail-biting-117-round-final,"The Paris Major champions lift their first trophy of 2024 and end apEX's 10-year hunt for the title in Cologne. Vitality are champions of IEM Cologne 2024 after laboring to a 3-1 victory over Natus Vincere in a clear contender for series of the year. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire missed his previous two chances to lift the trophy in the LANXESS in 2015 and 2019, but finally lifted the silverware to end a ten-year-long chase and bag Vitality their first title win in 2024. ""Finally, after three Cologne finals, I'm leaving with the trophy,"" the ecstatic French captain told Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere after the match. He had every right to be overjoyed after he called a fantastic game in an incredibly back-and-forth series, with the first three maps decided by the slimmest of margins and Mirage being one of the best maps we've seen this year. NAVI will lament their chance to bag back-to-back trophies after their Esports World Cup victory, but with their third final in a row and a thunderous show of force in the series, continue to make clear their status as the team to beat among the best in the world. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius will be left in particularly dour spirits, the former unable to break his curse in best-of-five grand finals (now 0-7 in series, 2-21 in maps) and the latter finishing the series at the bottom of the board — a far cry from his Major-MVP level. Natus Vincere were hamstrung at the start of their series with leading MVP candidate Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy pummeled in a woeful 1-11 first half on Nuke. A 3K and 1v1 clutch from jL was the sole beacon of light for the Copenhagen Major champions, helping them to a three-round streak, but with firepower not making the difference for Natus Vincere and apEX steps ahead of Aleksib tactically, Vitality romped ahead to an 8-4 lead. b1t's nightmare continued as apEX called a Ramp attack into him to net Vitality the second pistol, but that 10-4 lead didn't last long: A triple spraydown from Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov to fend off an A rush let Natus Vincere stabilize, and in the absence of b1t, Mihai ""iM"" Ivan stepped up. The Romanian was a stalwart for Natus Vincere in late rounds and repeatedly found multi-kills in rotation and at Door to power a comeback effort to overtime. However, his efforts weren't enough to make up for two crucial clutches going Vitality's way at the eleventh hour and superb entries from apEX, who made the difference to clinch a 16-13 win. Clip: apEX entries and ZywOo clutch set Vitality on map point NAVI won their first pistol to kick off Dust2, and despite Vitality disrupting their early defaults, jumped up to a 5-2 lead. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut came alive with two huge multi-kill rounds to get Vitality back into the game, including one on a low-buy, but Natus Vincere went into the break with the lead and extended that with a second pistol and conversion, 9-5. Vitality had a clear game plan to abuse jL and b1t on B, and it was working: the defenses crumbled time and time again, but two back-to-back improbable retakes from NAVI stemmed the bleeding in a map that could've rapidly spiraled out of control. That abuse kept coming, though, as Vitality inched toward forcing overtime, but b1t went from absent on map one to a hero on Dust2 by recovering a 4v5 with a single-handed shutdown of the site to clinch victory. Clip: b1t shuts down B to win Dust2 NAVI, having recovered from losing their pick, came into Mirage with heads held high, a 12-map winstreak giving all the confidence they could have needed. A loss to a force-buy made for a poor start, however, and Vitality used that to run up a 5-1 lead with players disrupting NAVI's preparation by popping up in different spots than their normal positions. iM again was the hero for Natus Vincere with two big clutches and a Paris-Major resplendent level, which allowed NAVI to win six straight to end the half and gain the lead in the second, dominating in entries and going big in late-rounds for a 12-10 lead. Those chances to close the map was squandered by Natus Vincere, though, and in overtime ZywOo stepped in spades. His impact in overtime was immense as he single-handedly won two rounds, and w0nderful came alive too late as Vitality edged out a win in a triple overtime affair that contends for map of the year. The usual trend from a blowout map like that is the next ends up one-sided in a flat end to the series, and that seemed exactly what was destined. Vitality again came into Inferno with an excellent game plan and brutalized Natus Vincere in Banana round after round, and used that conditioning to run up a 10-2 lead at the break. Clip: mezii's heroic defense of A to set Vitality on series point A pistol win for Vitality, and it was over. Or so it seemed, until Natus Vincere showed immense mental fortitude and won six rounds in a row to close the gap. Just when the comeback looked to be a reality, however, William ""mezii"" Merriman bagged a triple kill as the sole A defender to set his side on series point, and Vitality finally got the job done two rounds later to clinch their tournament title.",18-8-2024 23:29,1724016540000
ZywOo earns 20th HLTV MVP at IEM Cologne,https://www.hltv.org/news/39648/zywoo-earns-20th-hltv-mvp-at-iem-cologne,"Vitality's superstar stepped up in the LANXESS with a 1.34 rating in playoffs and overtakes device on the all-time list of HLTV MVPs. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut has earned his 20th HLTV x 1XBET Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after starring in Vitality's intense run to the IEM Cologne trophy. The Frenchman has now overtaken Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz on the all-time list, and is just one behind his great rival Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev who has 21 career MVP medals. Find all HLTV MVP winners on our dedicated MVP page. It is also his second LAN Cologne MVP after winning it in his rookie year at ESL One Cologne 2019, where Vitality lost to Liquid (and online for Cologne 2020 Europe during the pandemic.) This time, he leaves with both the medal and the trophy. HLTV all-time MVP winners (CS:GO and CS2) Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev: 21 (5 online) Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut: 20 (6) Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz: 19 (3) Christopher ""GeT_RiGhT"" Alesund: 10 Kenny ""kennyS"" Schrub: 10 The MVP also puts ZywOo straight back into the race for a historic fourth HLTV player of the year title against upstarts Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov, given Cologne's status as one of the most prestigious events in the calendar. ""I will work harder every day to get back on my level,"" ZywOo said to James ""BanKs"" Banks on stage after winning the trophy in a trademark display of his modesty. ""It was a hard tournament for me, my teammates helped me a lot."" While few players would say that after a 1.31 rating at an event, ZywOo was right to credit his teammates. He hit some sky-high peaks before the final, with 1.76, 1.96, 1.86, and 1.77 map ratings before the final, but was less consistent than Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan in groups and had a tough series against FaZe. Even after the fantastic final, ZywOo ended on the exact same kills per round win (1.03) and average damage per round win (103.4) as flameZ over the event. Ultimately ZywOo's step-up in the playoffs (1.34 rating, with flameZ on 1.17)  was what counted against his teammate and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan and Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy from Natus Vincere to secure the MVP. And, as much as his humility should be admired, the arena is what matters most — and that is where we saw ZywOo maintain his sky-high standards as others faltered, with a 1.29 rating after 117 gruelling rounds against the world No. 1 in an instant classic of a grand final.",18-8-2024 23:39,1724017140000
"ZywOo: ""I had never played this kind of final""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39649/zywoo-i-had-never-played-this-kind-of-final,"The French superstar said Vitality needed the boost from this win after losses in Dallas and EPL and added they ""have so much more to bring to the table."" Vitality emerged victorious from a thriller of a best-of-five grand final at IEM Cologne, taking down Natus Vincere in the nearly 120-round title decider to secure their first trophy of the year. Consistent as always and putting on a team-high 1.31 rating in the overtime-filled grand final affair, Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut came away with the HLTV Most Valuable Player Award. After the match, the French superstar spoke with HLTV about the victory and finally getting to the top step of the podium after two failed attempts. ""It was an amazing final to play,"" he said. ""I had never played this kind of final, and finally we won it. We really needed it after the losses in Dallas and EPL."" ZywOo overtook Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz for the second-most HLTV MVPs and is now just one away from tying Oleksandr ""s1mple"" Kostyliev's 21 medals. But when asked about the chance to break that record at a time when the Ukrainian doesn't seem to be making a comeback anytime soon, ZywOo was humble as always: ""I'm thinking about that, but at the same time, I don't care,"" he said. ""I'm not thinking about getting an MVP every time I play a tournament."" Congratulations on your victory. A crazy series with some really close games. What is going through your head? Ah, a lot of things. Now the pressure is going down. It was an amazing final to play, to be honest. I had never played this kind of final, and finally we won it. Yeah, amazing. It's tough to say something because the pressure is going down. We're just happy. Everyone is smiling now and it's amazing. I just want to thank my teammates because they played really well as well. It was a great final. Before the match, you had said you needed to play your best game to win. Are you happy with the way the team played? I think we played a good game, but it could have been way better. It's the final, so there's a lot more pressure on the table. Sometimes, we didn't play our game. But in the end, we won. Obviously, we're going to watch the match and talk about the mistakes we made. But in the end, we won, and we are just so happy with the results. This is your first trophy of 2024 after losing two finals. How does it feel to finally lift a trophy this year? We had kind of a joke. It was, like, 'If we win Cologne, we're just going to forget about Dallas and EPL.' And now, after winning Cologne, we're just going to enjoy. Our goal this year was to lift one trophy at least, and we've done it. We are happy, and we're just going to enjoy it now. apEX had been to two finals here in Cologne. He said in an interview with us that he really wanted to win this tournament or Katowice before he retires. Are you happy that you guys managed to win this one for him? Yeah, of course. We're obviously happy for him. Like he said in the interview, he wanted to win Cologne or a Major. I think we didn't really talk about that, but everyone did it for him. Everyone was really focused, working really hard before the second season. We were really prepared and we were focused on that. apEX, us, the team, we were ready to fight. You had the support of the Golden Hornets here, but it felt like most of the crowd was cheering for NAVI. What was it like to play against the crowd here? Actually, I didn't feel the crowd was favoring NAVI or anything because we were too focused and the Golden Hornets were on our side and gave us a lot of power and energy. So I didn't feel this. The Golden Hornets gave us everything and we're just going to enjoy this tonight with them and have a good drink. You had a massive lead now on Inferno but you took some time to close it out. It seemed like you were getting a little bit frustrated until that massive round from mezii. Why do you think that it took you so long to close it out? Do you think that maybe you were trying to hurry things up a little bit? Yeah, a bit. Maybe we took it too easy because we were leading 11-2 and we were maybe thinking that we had already won. But I didn't feel any frustration, I just felt that we were maybe playing a bit more scared or not together because we wanted to finish the game. But some players were talking during the game to say, like, 'Just take your time, we know what we can do during the game.' And we just finished it in a good way. You now have 20 MVP medals, the second-most overall, and you're just one behind s1mple. How does that make you feel, and do you think it's possible to beat s1mple this year? Maybe. I mean, if I have another MVP, I will be on the same level. To be honest, I'm thinking about that, but at the same time, I don't care. It's weird because I'm not thinking about getting an MVP every time I play a tournament. Obviously, the last day of the tournament I'm thinking about it, but when I am with the team, I'm not thinking about that. I'm just doing my thing, playing with my team. That's it. We are now entering a very busy period of the season. We have the BLAST Finals, IEM Rio and, of course, the Major. How big of a boost is this victory for the team? To be honest, it's going to be a good boost because we really needed it after the losses in Dallas and EPL. We have so much more to bring to the table. We know we made some mistakes. We have so much to improve and we can do so much better. So it's going to be a good momentum boost for the rest of the year. And hopefully, we'll lift another trophy.",19-8-2024 00:30,1724020200000
IEM Cologne 2024 reaches third highest non-Major peak in CS history at 1.05M viewers,https://www.hltv.org/news/39651/iem-cologne-2024-reaches-third-highest-non-major-peak-in-cs-history-at-105m-viewers,"Only the 2022 editions of IEM Cologne and IEM Katowice reached higher peak viewer counts than Vitality and Natus Vincere's barn burner of a final. IEM Cologne 2024's grand final broke the 1,000,000-viewer mark, making it the event with the third-highest peak in Counter-Strike history outside of the Majors. Its peak count of 1,051,810, recorded during the final by Esports Charts, puts the 2024 edition of IEM Cologne in a select group of only four non-Major events to break the 1M viewer barrier. Most-watched non-Major events of all time, per Esports Charts IEM Cologne 2022 - 1,249,426 IEM Katowice 2022 - 1,122,015 IEM Cologne 2024 - 1,051,810 IEM Katowice 2020 - 1,002,132 IEM Katowice 2024 - 972,312 This year's IEM Cologne only trails IEM Katowice 2022 and IEM Cologne 2022, two events that FaZe won in dramatic fashion. First over G2, in a series which included a 31-27 marathon on Mirage, and then over Natus Vincere in one of the greatest series of all time, a best-of-five that went the distance. The Vitality and Natus Vincere final from this year's thriller now joins that pantheon, edging ahead of the IEM Katowice 2020 final between G2 and Natus Vincere that was held without fans at the Spodek Arena due to the outbreak of Covid-19. IEM Cologne 2024 reaching 1.05 million viewers puts it in 12th place on the all-time Esports Charts list once you include Majors, ahead of PGL Major Krakow 2017 (961,413) and StarLadder Major Berlin (836,306). It's still far below the all-time peak of 2.7 million viewers, however, which was reached at the first post-pandemic arena event, PGL Major Stockholm 2021, and the CS2 peak of 1.85 million hit at PGL Major Copenhagen earlier in 2024.",19-8-2024 11:11,1724058660000
Vitality join the Intel Grand Slam race,https://www.hltv.org/news/39652/vitality-join-the-intel-grand-slam-race,"Five teams are currently in contention for the $1 million prize. The Intel Grand Slam pattern has been broken. G2 had won two eligible events out of seven, MOUZ two out of five, FaZe two out of three, and Spirit a single one to create a 'V' shape in the official Intel Grand Slam graphic (which can be seen in the tweet below). But everyone knows that V is for Vitality, the newest team in the running after winning IEM Cologne. The French organization's incursion into the IGS standings also comes at the best possible moment, as IEM Cologne is an ESL Pro Tour Championship tournament (as are IEM Katowice and ESL-operated Majors). Winning one of these EPT Championships is one of the two requirements, along with winning four tournaments in a 10-tournament window, needed to pick up the $1 million prize. Vitality joining the fray means that the teams already in the running are one tournament closer to losing their eligibility due to the 10-tournament window rule. G2 have an EPT Championship under their belt from last year's IEM Cologne, but they must win two in a row at ESL Pro League and IEM Rio to complete the gauntlet. MOUZ have one more chance than G2, but no EPT Championship, and FaZe have one more chance than MOUZ, and also no EPT Championship. Spirit have only one title under their belt and five chances left, and their one title is an EPT Championship earned earlier this year at IEM Katowice. The IGS race is made up of: G2 (2 chances remaining) MOUZ (3 chances remaining) FaZe (4 chances remaining) Spirit (5 chances remaining) Vitality (9 chances remaining) The next eligible events are: ESL Pro League Season 20 — September 3-22IEM Rio 2024 — October 7-13",19-8-2024 12:25,1724063100000
Vitality added to BLAST World Final team list,https://www.hltv.org/news/39653/vitality-added-to-blast-world-final-team-list,"The IEM Cologne champions will face Natus Vincere, Spirit, and five other teams in November at the $1,000,000 event. Vitality are the third team to receive an invite to BLAST Premier World Final, the $1,000,000 event that has closed the year since its inception in 2021. This year, the Shanghai Major will have that honor, and it is still unclear exactly when the World Final will take place because of a scheduling conflict with the RMR qualifiers for the Major. The location is also yet to be announced after BLAST's deal with Abu Dhabi expired. The World Final's pitch is to bring the best teams of the year to one small eight-team LAN, and BLAST achieves that by inviting the winners of the biggest events: Major winners NAVI, IEM Katowice champions Spirit, and now IEM Cologne victors Vitality. Two slots also go to winners of the other BLAST Premier stadium events, Spring Final (which Spirit won) and Fall Final. The final slots are then decided by the BLAST Premier leaderboard, including if a team, like Spirit, wins two events that normally result in an invitation. Four slots will be decided this way, with FaZe and G2 now in fourth and fifth place after IEM Cologne. The final two spots will be more of a brawl, with MOUZ and Astralis in the lead but plenty of ranking points up for grabs at the final three events (ESL Pro League S20, BLAST Showdown, and BLAST Fall Final) before rosters lock on October 23. Due to Valve's rules around partner leagues, 2024 will be the final iteration of the World Final in this format. It will be replaced in spirit by BLAST Rivals, a bi-annual eight-team event that will invite teams using Valve's World Ranking.

Vitality claim No.1 spot after IEM Cologne victory,https://www.hltv.org/news/39656/vitality-claim-no1-spot-after-iem-cologne-victory,"Vitality's win in Cologne was enough to see them surpass NAVI in the HLTV world ranking. IEM Cologne 2024 marked itself firmly in CS history over the past couple of weeks, not only by being the first iteration of the prestigious event to be played in CS2, but also due to SAW's historic underdog run and an instant-classic of a grand final, where Vitality defeated Natus Vincere to return to the top of the world ranking. As a result of the history-making that went down in Germany there was not only one team that experienced movement in the world ranking, with SAW and Spirit also seeing notable shifts. Thanks to their impressive run to the trophy at IEM Cologne Vitality have jumped two places in HLTV's world ranking to reclaim their place atop the pile, which they vacated in February of this year. apEX's side had not claimed a single title prior to their arrival in Germany, kicking off their season with a poor showing at IEM Katowice before finding their feet and claiming a litany of top-four and second-place finishes. 2023's team of the year did not drop a series on their way to the ultimate prize in Cologne and racked up a resume that included wins over FaZe, MOUZ, and incumbent No. 1 team Natus Vincere in the grand final. Powered by tournament MVP Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut and their ever-potent offensive halves Vitality had to battle through a 117-round epic to secure the title, making for a well-earned return to top billing. Portuguese squad SAW were the surprise package of IEM Cologne, a Cinderella run that began in the Play-in taking them all the way to the semi-finals. With a powerful trio of youngsters, potent teamwork, and effective anti-stratting at their disposal, SAW upset the likes of G2 and FaZe across a rousing campaign that was ended by eventual winners Vitality. In bagging an admirable top-four SAW made the deepest run at a Big Event of any Portuguese side in history, making their country proud and firmly building upon the promise they showed earlier in the year. They have been duly rewarded with a significant leap to the organization's peak HLTV ranking. The final notable ranking change saw Spirit slide down to No. 5 after their woeful performances in Cologne. The Russian side posted double-digit round totals on only one of the four maps they played, and exited the tournament without a win to their name.",19-8-2024 19:07,1724087220000

IEM Cologne grand final day as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39647/iem-cologne-grand-final-day-as-it-happened,"That's where the trouble began. That smile. damned smile.

We would not have played Inferno CT that badly. We had an extended break to gather our thoughts, but they fully dominated us anyway. They deserved it."" On positives: ""I'm so proud, but it hurts a lot. There were a lot of map points. I'm happy. It was a banger of a final, both teams played a 3-0 CT side, an amazing game to play. But going home after Inferno sucks."" On B1ad3: ""He did a good job, in overtime you get one more timeout. He was really involved, between maps as well, and everything was needed in such a long game."" The curse continues... It's hard to think of one better. An instant classic, especially that Mirage. Speaking to Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere on stage: On Mirage: ""We threw three map points on Mirage. I told everyone, stay calm, shit happens, we didn't play well, but let's focus. Everyone had a good moment individually."" They took their time — closing Inferno out, and to get their first trophy of 2024 — but Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire and company have done it. apEX lost Cologne finals in 2015 and 2019. He lost finals at Dallas and Pro League in 2024. It's third time lucky in both cases. Vitality 12-8  Natus Vincere Vitality 11-7  Natus Vincere We don't want to jinx them, but that's five in a row. Four more and we're even. Vitality 11-3  Natus Vincere Four kills and a 1v1 clutch. A chance? Vitality 11-2  Natus Vincere The mental battle is over. It would take a miracle from here. Vitality 10-2  Natus Vincere Look at that dance of happiness! Vitality 9-2  Natus Vincere Vitality 7-1  Natus Vincere More pain for NAVI in the clutch. What a reverse from yesterday. Vitality 6-1  Natus Vincere Brutal opening for NAVI. They can't get anything done on this defence. Mirage seems to have broken them mentally. Vitality 1-0  Natus Vincere The usual trend after a map three like that would be NAVI getting blown out on map four. But are Andrey ""B1ad3"" Gorodenskiy's men made of sterner stuff? Pistol goes against them. This series is delivering on all accounts, and the viewership is there to match: according to ESCharts, Natus Vincere vs. Vitality peaked at 1,050,002 viewers at the end of Mirage, the third-highest non-Major peak in Counter-Strike history. Here are the top-four non-Major peaks after the new entry: IEM Cologne 2022 - 1,249,426IEM Katowice 2022 - 1,122,015IEM Cologne 2024 - 1,050,002IEM Katowice 2020 - 1,002,132 Inferno will begin at roughly 21:35 . Go get your dinner, this is far from over. They needed six map points but Vitality have done it! Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut ends on 36, and Mihai ""iM"" Ivan on 37. What a battle all the way through — a real contender for game of the year. Vitality 19-20  Natus Vincere This is masterful from Mihai ""iM"" Ivan, his 11th multi-kill. Milliseconds in it! Vitality 18-18  Natus Vincere Five map points squandered by Vitality! Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov was 17-22 after that whiff on Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut, but is now up to 25-23. Serious recovery from the young gun under the lights. Vitality 17-15  Natus Vincere Ihor ""w0nderful"" Zhdanov's nerves are showing at the worst possible time, as Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut wakes up. Vitality 16-15  Natus Vincere We've barely said Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's name this map, but he's accumulated 26 frags and the latest two were disgusting. Watch for yourself. Vitality 15-15  Natus Vincere First NAVI get Mihai ""iM"" Ivan into Window to flank B, and then at 15-14 Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen calls the A Rush at a perfect time. Vitality 13-13  Natus Vincere NAVI miss the bomb falling on Short and Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi takes full advantage. Vitality 12-12  Natus Vincere Vitality emerged winners on Nuke, what happens this time? NAVI have looked the better side in gun rounds, you must say. Vitality 10-12  Natus Vincere Mihai ""iM"" Ivan is in flow state, swinging everything — even a scoped up Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut — but finding the coolness required in the late round. Fantastic CT side play again. There's a reason he has a 1.60 (!!!) CT rating in Cologne so far. Vitality 10-9  Natus Vincere Thanks for the clutch Mihai ""iM"" Ivan! Unfortunately, CS2 is a bad game and winning it put NAVI in a terrible economic situation. Vitality 7-9  Natus Vincere Vitality 5-7  Natus Vincere 5-1 to 5-7 in a flash. NAVI looking good on home turf. Vitality 5-3  Natus Vincere There is a conscious effort from Vitality to upset NAVI's game plan, just like on Dust2. Players are popping up far from their usual positions: Connector player Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire hiding on Bench on B, Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi on A, or Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut under Balcony. But NAVI, after some economy struggles, are starting to work it out. Desk slam from apEX. Vitality 2-1  Natus Vincere Pistol went NAVI's way but that doesn't mean an automatic 3-0. Lovely Connector setup from Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire and Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan. Vitality 0-1  Natus Vincere Third pistol in a row for NAVI. One streak must end. But the desk aren't as convinced by Vitality's, who faced lower opposition and are more reliant on all-in executes than NAVI's brutal defaults. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's men the favorites for a 2-1 lead. 11-10, Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan is set perfectly to catch NAVI pushing Doors. But then he messes up the jump on the box. His fault, or the game's? Vitality 10-13  Natus Vincere ""Absent on map one, but shows up in map two,"" exclaims Chad ""SPUNJ"" Burchill as Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy secures Dust2 in the 4v5. Vitality 8-11  Natus Vincere Two improbable retakes, but Vitality go back to the well with a third B pop and it succeeds. NAVI need to sort B out - retakes just aren't sustainable. You can see it on Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen's face. He's worried. Vitality 7-11  Natus Vincere Most teams would have saved. And they would have been right to. But NAVI pull it off! And they do it again the round after: A 2v3 on B this time. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire is going to pull his hair out. Vitality 7-9  Natus Vincere Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius had to start round 16 with just a Deagle, and the round is decided by one frag: A Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan entry onto jL's bonnet. You have to wonder how he would have done with an M4 and full utility. Vitality 6-9  Natus Vincere Vitality 5-8  Natus Vincere 2/2 pistols for Vitality on Nuke, and 2/2 for Natus Vincere on Dust2. Vitality 4-6  Natus Vincere Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut caught some flak from Janko ""YNk"" Paunović for a quiet Nuke but Dust2 is his playground for a reason. Shades of Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz in that one: Vitality 3-5  Natus Vincere Oh no NAVI. You have Vitality where you want them but it comes undone against Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut's Deagle. Vitality 2-5  Natus Vincere Oof, Not what he needed. Vitality 2-3  Natus Vincere Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan pushes Long to kill Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy, and then — in a 5v3 no less — Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi pushes the B Tunnels smoke to catch Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius. We know NAVI are a gameplan-heavy team, and Vitality don't want to let them dictate the pace. Vitality 0-1  Natus Vincere Dust2 will be a crucial pivot map for this series. Vitality have picked it often as of late, and NAVI will have to contend with the full extent of Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut and co's firepower. The Vitality fans will have enjoyed that one. He smashed SAW yesterday and map one ends with Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire top of the scoreboard. Vitality 16-14  Natus Vincere He may have got annoyed at his teammates but what a response from Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire individually! The choke from 10-4 to 12-12 on T side could have broken him. Instead, it vitalized (pun intended) him. Vitality's captain ends the map 6-0 in openers, with 23 frags and 6 multi-kills. Vitality14-14  Natus Vincere NAVI could have won this round in so many different ways. But France says no. Great mechanics from the Woo too! Vitality 13-13  Natus Vincere Scoreboard topping performance from the Romanian who has been so good on CT side all event. That pistol whiff is all but forgotten! Vitality 12-12  Natus Vincere Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire finds the gap but Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius says no to Vitality! 10-4 becomes 12-12. Vitality 12-11  Natus Vincere He's talked the talk and now he's walked the walk, with two key kills to start round 23. Vitality 11-11  Natus Vincere Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire's frustration is boiling over now — just like it did against Spirit in London. Can't be helping his mates on Vitality. Vitality 11-10  Natus Vincere NAVI's comeback is getting more and more momentum, and you can see the stress on Vitality. Bit of a hairdryer treatment from Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire in the tactical timeout. Let's see if it works. Vitality 11-7  Natus Vincere Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius is so often the reliable closer for Natus Vincere but Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi — who is having a great game at 17-9 now — gets the W. Key that the Israeli continues, a man who has been criticised for his arena play by the likes of Mathieu ""Maniac"" Quiquerez this year. Vitality 10-6  Natus Vincere 0/2 in pistols for NAVI this game, but a good start to the CT side when it comes to the gun rounds. Vitality 10-5  Natus Vincere As always, we'll have the best shots from the arena all day courtesy of Radosław ""MAKKU"" Makuch and Josip ""brcho"" Brtan. See the full gallery here. Vitality 10-4  Natus Vincere Psychological warfare from Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire. Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy is 1-11 at the half, and then he calls a Ramp rush right into the Ukrainian with Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan getting the easy entry. Long way back now. Vitality 8-4  Natus Vincere Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire pumped his fist after a key gun round win earlier on, knowing he had called the Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen fake correctly. Two great tactical sides here, which means it might come down to firepower — and NAVI need more from Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy, who has been their best player this event and got the MVP at EWC. Vitality 3-2  Natus Vincere Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius was the fuel behind NAVI's Mirage comeback yesterday with two key first half clutches. And he's delivered early on in the final — like he always does in these arena matches. Vitality 1-0  Natus Vincere William ""mezii"" Merriman should have had the highlight of the pistol round with three from Silo, but it's Mihai ""iM"" Ivan who gets the headline — for all the wrong reasons. He need to put this whiff out of his mind. And soon. Let's check in on the statistics behind the runs of Natus Vincere and Vitality to get a temperature check ahead of the grand final. CT side stats T side stats As we can see Vitality, as they have all year long, have been heavily reliant on their T sides. Their offensive halves, and how Natus Vincere handle them, will be key to this grand final. Natus Vincere meanwhile will want to take advantage of the poor CT sides of Vitality. Another thing to note is Natus Vincere's strong 4v5% on both sides; Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen is great at calling with the information garnered from an opening kill, even when it's one of his own players dying. Vitality player stats NAVI player stats Both teams have been getting fantastic production out of their players across the board. Many eyes will be on Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut, as he has a propensity to disappear in the big games at prestige events. Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen fans, look away. The Finnish IGL has a torrid record in BO5 matches at Big Events, stretching all the way back to 2019. He's only managed to win a single map across four series. Can he break that streak today? Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen spoke with James ""BanKs"" Banks on the broadcast ahead of the grand final, with the Finn thinking now was the time for his team to finally beat Vitality. On what it means for NAVI to reach three grand finals in a row: I think everything, right? Reaching three grand finals in a row is super good, reaching our goals step by step. Now we just need to challenge the BO5, challenge Vitality who are looking pretty strong, but so are we. On his bad BO5 record: I don't look at it at all. I know what we're capable of, I really trust this group of people and I know they trust me, so no matter the circumstances I know we can do it. On the matchup with Vitality: I feel like if there is a time for us to beat Vitality, it is now. We've practiced them a lot, we know their style, they're really explosive and have really good talents, but you've got to beat them some time. Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut had a quick chat with Eefje ""sjokz"" Depoortere as he entered the arena before the grand final, and he was clear about his team's need to focus on themselves. ZywOo: ""We didn't think about the past, we are in the present now. For the game we will just focus on ourselves. I think NAVI are one of the best teams right now, so we need to play our best game to win."" ""We know we have one of the best teams in Vitality right now, so if all five play good, we can win this."" Recent history does not favour Natus Vincere. Over the last two years Vitality have dominated this matchup, racking up a sizeable winstreak against their opponents in today's grand final. The stage is set for the showdown between Vitality and Natus Vincere, the best team of 2023 and arguably the best team of 2024 thus far. Up to this point in 2024, Vitality have been short of the form that saw them win five significant trophies last year, but here in Cologne, they have been back to their best. Natus Vincere were accused by many of fluking their Major win back in Copenhagen, but since then they have been working hard to prove the doubters wrong, and now may very well be playing the best CS of any team in the world. IEM Cologne would be the perfect place for Vitality to inject new life into their season, or for Natus Vincere to tighten their grip on the top spot in the world rankings. Who will take the trophy?",18-8-2024 23:45,1724017500000
"C9, B8 secure last Rio EU closed qualifier spots",https://www.hltv.org/news/39657/c9-b8-secure-last-rio-eu-closed-qualifier-spots,"NIP, ENCE, BLEED, and Monte won't have the chance to fight for a spot at the Brazilian event. The second IEM Rio Europe open qualifier has wrapped with Cloud9 and B8 advancing past 500 and Monte, respectively, to complete the list of teams who will fight over two spots at IEM Rio in the closed qualifier. ENCE were among the notable names who failed to advance, falling to No. 98-ranked kONO in a worrying loss ahead of the RMR closed qualifiers on Wednesday. Cloud9 were tested in the top half of the bracket, facing two of the four highest-ranked teams out of the top-16 in BLEED and Ninjas in Pyjamas. Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović's troops nearly recovered from a dismal 3-9 T half on Anubis courtesy of a 2.16-rated CT effort from Joakim ""jkaem"" Myrbostad, but fell short in round 24 and had their qualifier run ended in the Round of 16. Ninjas in Pyjamas fared even worse on the same map as they started up 5-0 and 6-1 on the T side, but won just one round after that in a woeful display of Counter-Strike, with Emil ""HeatoN"" Christensen calling it a ""horrible showing"" and saying the team played ""like a FACEIT level-eight mix."" Cloud9's new lineup, meanwhile, looked solid with more time together under their belts, with its star trio all ending the qualifier averaging a 1.24 rating or higher across four maps. The team nearly let an 11-5 lead slip on 500's pick of Ancient in the qualifying match, but demolished the Bulgarian team 13-1 on Dust2 to advance with a more convincing win. B8 also had a close call against AMKAL in their Round of 16 match and needed overtime to take the win, but comfortably dispatched of Sashi 13-6 in the quarter-final to set up a qualifying game against Monte. The Polish-majority squad was almost indomitable on the CT side of Ancient, going up 9-3, but tallied just two T rounds in a shameful second half that allowed B8 to close out their pick. Mirage was less contentious as B8 edged out a two-round lead at the break and didn't relent, closing out the game 13-8 before Monte had a chance to recover. The eight teams who will compete from August 26-28 in a double-elimination, best-of-three bracket for two spots at IEM Rio are:",19-8-2024 23:17,1724102220000
"Valve take stance against Snap Tap-like features, remove jump-throw binds",https://www.hltv.org/news/39658/valve-take-stance-against-snap-tap-like-features-remove-jump-throw-binds,"""We are no longer going to allow automation via scripting or hardware that circumvent core coordination skills,"" the developers said. Valve have issued a blog post addressing the usage of keyboard hardware features and scripts that allow players to partially automate their movement in-game. In it, the developers have taken a hard stance against such features, which recently became a hot topic in the community following the release of Snap Tap and SOCD on Razer and Wooting keyboards, respectively. The two keyboard features, along with a config script equivalent known as 'null binds,' effectively removed the skill of coordinating multiple movement key presses while counter-strafing by prioritizing the latest key press. This is against Valve's idea of what is acceptable in Counter-Strike, the statement says, and players using these features will be kicked from their matches on official servers moving forward. ""Developing one's coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike. Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we've decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn't acceptable in Counter-Strike,"" the statement reads. ""We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match."" To prevent ""accidental infractions,"" Valve also disabled in-game binds that include ""more than one movement and/or attack action."" Other than the aforementioned null binds, this also includes various jump-throw binds that have become prevalent in both professional and casual play. Valve has urged players who have a keyboard with input automation to disable the feature before they play on official servers. The hard ban on these aids comes at a crucial time. The qualification process for the Perfect World Shanghai Major begins later this week with online qualifiers taking place all around the world — some as soon as two days following the change. It is expected to impact professional play substantially, not least because keyboards with these features have quickly become widespread among pro players following their release this summer. With Valve's response also removing step-jump-throws, which allowed various advanced utility to be thrown with absolute precision, there is precious little time for players to adjust to the changes.",20-8-2024 00:18,1724105880000
Jump-throw grunt now audible to opponents; VacNet 3.0 testing begins in new update,https://www.hltv.org/news/39659/jump-throw-grunt-now-audible-to-opponents-vacnet-30-testing-begins-in-new-update,"A minor gameplay change and a rollout of a new anti-cheat measure were tacked on in Valve's latest update. Valve took a firm stance against Snap Tap-like features and scripts that allow players to partially automate their movement in its latest update, rolling out measures to ignore certain multi-input binds and to detect and kick players from Valve-official servers for hardware-assisted counter strafing. Two smaller entries in the patch notes may have been overshadowed by the resulting conversation, one being that the grunt sound made to confirm a successful jump-throw is now audible to nearby players. The other is Valve taking further steps to combat cheating with the testing of ""VacNet 3.0"" on ""a limited set of matches,"" with the developer asking to be informed in case of any accidental cancellations at its team feedback email. The complete patch notes can be found below: INPUT - Certain types of movement/shooting input automation such as hardware-assisted counter strafing will now be detected on Valve official servers, resulting in a kick from the match - Input binds that include more than one of the following commands will now be ignored by default. Support can be re-enabled using the cheat-protected convar 'cl_allow_multi_input_binds 1' sprint, reload, attack, attack2, turnleft, turnright, turnup, turndown, forward, back, left, right, moveup, movedown, klook, use, jump, duck, strafe, zoom, yaw, pitch, forwardback, rightleft - The jump-throw confirmation grunt sound can now be heard by other players nearby VacNet - Initial testing of VacNet 3.0 has begun on a limited set of matches.

Community reacts: Jump-throw binds are caught in the crossfire of Valve's Snap Tap ban,https://www.hltv.org/news/39660/community-reacts-jump-throw-binds-are-caught-in-the-crossfire-of-valves-snap-tap-ban,"Pro players showed their shock on social media last night, as Valve removed jump-throw binds just two days before the Shanghai Major RMR qualifiers. Valve, a little over one month since Razer's Snap Tap feature was released and imitated by Wooting and SteelSeries, have made their stance clear: You are not allowed to use these keyboard programs in-game. ""We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match,"" their news post read. In order to effectively kick Snap Tap users, all binds with more than one movement or attack action have also been disabled. This means that jump-throw binds have also been banned, a decision that has left professional players scrambling to learn new grenade lineups just two days before the Major qualifiers. First of all, however, the response to the Snap Tap ban has been positive, with key advocate and KZ-fanatic Robin ""ropz"" Kool weighing in first. Keyboard manufacturer Wooting, who also argued against Snap Tap before introducing it to their hardware after a consumer poll, have also welcomed the news. Jokes were made at the expense of players who rushed to buy Razer keyboards, only for their key feature to be banned one month later. Razer's Senior Esports Ambassador Jimmy Malavong also saw the funny side. But the majority of professional players' reactions have not centered on Snap Tap at all, as they show dismay at Valve's decision to remove jump-throw binds. A small sub-section of the community, however, welcomed the change in a hope that harder lineups will increase the skill ceiling. A challenge for Valve — if they do want to enforce the ban long-term — will be avoiding easy workarounds, such as simply using two keys for jump throws: One for jump, and one for '-attack,' (a bind for releasing mouse1 more accurately) and simply pressing them at the same time. This method was common in CS:GO when jump throw binds were banned by ESL and other TOs.",20-8-2024 12:11,1724148660000

BLAST ban Snap Tap for Showdown onwards,https://www.hltv.org/news/39665/blast-ban-snap-tap-for-showdown-onwards,"BLAST is following Valve's stance on the movement-assisting keyboard systems. BLAST has banned the use of Snap Tap-like assistants from Fall Showdown onwards, the tournament organizer has confirmed to HLTV. ""Due to the recent update and stance from Valve, BLAST will not allow the use of the Snap Tap and SOCD or similar assistants that produce the same outcome for Fall Showdown and all future BLAST events,"" a representative said in a statement. The statement focusses in on Snap Tap, and does not mention BLAST's stance on the jump-throw binds that Valve intended to remove from the game in their latest update. Since the patch, however, players have found workarounds that act as de facto jump-throw binds. Jump-throw scripts are valid in BLAST's current rulebook under clause 11.7.1, reading ""so-called 'Jumpthrow' scripts and binds are specifically allowed."" It remains unclear how BLAST will enforce the ruling, since the auto-kick upon detection of any Snap Tap-like system has only been rolled out for Valve Official Servers at the time of this article's publication. BLAST matches are played on third-party servers, and will not have access to the system. ESL, meanwhile, is yet to take a public stance on the matter.

The Perfect World Shanghai Major is more than three months away, but the first phase of the qualifying process for the premier competition is already due to start. Online qualifiers will run in Europe, North and South America and all over Asia in a super-week taking place from August 21-30, to find the remaining 29 out of 56 teams participating in November's Regional Major Ranking tournaments. Here's how it will all play out in each region: Only the 16 best teams as per Valve's Regional Standings can breathe easy in Europe after they've been invited directly to the RMR. Teams already at the RMRs (November 17-24) After open qualifiers were removed in the region, the only way to enter the Europe RMR is through the closed qualifiers, to which another 32 teams received invites based on the Valve ranking. The two tournaments will be played concurrently from August 21-23 in a Swiss format. The top eight teams in each group will advance to the RMR. Closed qualifiers (August 21-23) In the Americas, the eight highest-ranked teams according to Valve's Regional Standings have skipped the online qualifying stage and made it straight to the RMR. Teams already at the RMR (November 12-15) They will be joined by eight teams coming from closed qualifiers in North America and South America. Once again invited based on Valve's ranking, 16 teams will play in each sub-region for four spots at the RMR later this week: Closed qualifiers (August 26-28) Only three out of the eight participating teams in Asia have been directly invited to the RMR via Valve's Regional Standings: Teams already at the RMR (November 11-14) Five more teams will come from a series of two-stage qualifiers in China, Oceania, East Asia, Rest of Asia, and the Middle East, with each sub-region qualifying one team for the RMR. This is the only region to retain open qualifiers due to the lack of data there, and these will be used to fill each sub-regional closed qualifier up to eight teams. Open qualifiers - Arabia (August 21-22)- Levant and North Africa (August 21-22)- South Africa (August 21-22)- China (August 23-24)- Oceania (August 23-24)- East Asia (August 25-26)- Rest of Asia (August 25-26) Several other teams received invites straight to their respective closed qualifiers, though only Oceania had at least four teams ranked on the Valve Regional Standings: Closed qualifiers (August 27-30)",20-8-2024 21:02,1724180520000
JiJieHao bench Kjaerbye,https://www.hltv.org/news/39669/jijiehao-bench-kjaerbye,"Kjaerbye finds himself warming the bench after only officially joining the team on June 30. JiJieHao has moved Markus ""Kjaerbye"" Kjærbye to the bench, sources with knowledge of the matter told HLTV, bringing to an end to the Dane's short stint on the starting roster. HLTV knows that Kjaerbye is taking some time off to deal with personal issues. Last month, he revealed that he had lost his sister to cancer just days before the Esports World Cup. No official replacement has been announced, but JiJieHao have registered Viktor ""Duplicate"" Mitev as their fifth for the upcoming Arabia RMR open qualifier for Perfect World Shanghai Major. Kjaerbye joined JiJieHao officially in late June having been without a team for nearly two years, last turning out for Endpoint in September 2022. He did however feature for the squad in the Esports World Cup MENA closed qualifier in April. The Dane's only HLTV-recorded LAN appearance for JiJieHao came at Esports World Cup itself, where the team exited after a BO1 loss to Sashi. Kjaerbye struggled in the aforementioned game, garnering a 0.63 rating as he posted seven frags across 21 rounds.

"ESL forces teams to choose Rio or Atlanta qualifier due to ""fairness to all participants"" *",https://www.hltv.org/news/39670/esl-forces-teams-to-choose-rio-or-atlanta-qualifier-due-to-fairness-to-all-participants,"ESL mandated that the two qualifiers must have mutually exclusive teams. Update August 21, 10:10 : ESL provides explanation In a comment on the decision on X, SVP Game Ecosystems at ESL FACEIT Group Ulrich Schulze said the following: ""Ensuring that teams do not play in qualifiers for events that overlap, i.e. they cannot attend both, is not about reducing opportunities nor is it about extra work for ESL admins. It is about fairness to all participating teams in the qualifiers. ""If a team played in both qualifiers, won one of them and won or progressed far in the other qualifier, it would be unfair to any team they beat along the way in the qualifier of the event they ultimately did not attend. Simply inviting the runner-up of that qualifier would not solve for this. ""I understand how this may be a source of frustration for teams affected, but they would very likely be equally frustrated if they were on the other side of the situation I described above."" The team lists for the North America IEM Rio and ESL Challenger Atlanta closed qualifiers have been finalized following the conclusion of the open qualifiers. FLUFFY AIMERS and LAG join invited sides Liquid and Legacy in the battle for a spot in Rio, while NRG and Party Astronauts will face Nouns and Wildcard for a chance to play on home turf in Georgia, USA. ESL Challenger Atlanta is scheduled to run from October 4-6 and IEM Rio from October 7-13, leaving insufficient overlap for teams playing in the first event to arrive in time for the latter. However, the NA closed qualifiers for the tournaments do not overlap and are scheduled for August 29-30 and August 31 - September 1, respectively. Rather than allow teams to attempt to qualify for both tournaments and, in case one team qualifies for both, force them to pick between them, ESL mandated that teams had to pick the qualifier they wanted to compete in, including teams who were invited and those who advanced through the open qualifiers. NRG and Party Astronauts made it through the open brackets for both events but were forced to pick which closed stage they would compete in, with a third-place decider match played in the second Rio open qualifier to determine an extra replacement team ahead of Party Astronauts' decision. ESL's directive has been poorly received and openly criticized by teams and players in North America as it further reduces the already limited opportunities for upcoming teams to compete in international tournaments, particularly with both events taking place in the Americas.

Introducing HLTV attributes,https://www.hltv.org/news/39672/introducing-hltv-attributes,"There's a new way to find out the style of a player, rolling out today on all stats pages. There's plenty of ways to measure a player's performance. From our very own forums to broadcasts and debates elsewhere, you'll have heard plenty about Rating 2.0, kills per round, average damage per round (ADR), and the like. What is harder, on our stats pages right now, is establishing the type of player someone is. Someone's frag count or impact rating may correlate with certain roles but to confirm if someone is an aggressive opener, selfless entry fragger, or baity lurker, you would have to actually watch them play. Until now. We're rolling out seven HLTV Attributes that show you the style of a player, not their performance. It won't be perfect, nothing ever is, but our database can see far more games than any scout: This will give you a glimpse into every player from Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut down to a 15-year-old that is coming up in a local scene. It's split into seven categories, that complement each other to build a full picture of a player. Each player gets a score from 0-100 in the seven, and the full scale is used: It's not like FIFA, where 70 is a bad score. 50 is the average score for a top-tier professional player, based on CS2 averages over one event. When you click a player's main 0-100 score in a category, a dropdown of more advanced statistics becomes visible. These include the classics you expect to see, as well as new stats like how often a player is last alive, kills and damage in round wins, how many opening kills someone gets specifically with the AWP, and more. And, most importantly for all you hatemaxxers, we have saving stats too. If you're unsure on what any of the metrics are quantifying, just hover with your mouse and some text will come up explaining each in more detail. There's two key filters, a side one (with toggles for Terrorist, Counter-Terrorist, and both sides) and whether you want to see stats per round, or per 24 rounds. The idea of making it per 24 rounds is to make the stats more similar to what you might see on a matchmaking scoreboard. 0.83 kills per round is a fairly inconspicuous number on its own, but 20 frags per 24 rounds is something you know intuitively as an impressive figure.  It's also helpful for Fantasy: Jimi ""Jimpphat"" Salo averages 3.7 trade kills per 24 rounds (one of our new metrics launching with attributes), making him a decent choice for the Avenger (4 trade kills in one map) booster. Now, let's get into the categories themselves with some examples. The first one, Firepower, is a bit different in that it is more of a traditional performance measure but it is useful in showing a player's raw output. It only takes into account kills, damage, and multi-kills to show which players are dealing the most damage without any complications from high survival rates or good round-to-round consistency to differentiate it from Rating 2.0. We then get into the true stylistic measures, with Entrying. This is measured using traded death stats to see who is the most common lamb sent to slaughter on the bomb-site entry or CT setups. Its twin and opposite is Trading, which uses traded and assisted kills to highlight players more likely to be second into a site. In combination, these two can tell you a lot. High Entrying and low Trading will usually be a supportive sacrificial entry. The opposite will be a trademark baiter. Some players will be high in both, as versatile members of the map control pack happy to go first or second. And some lurkers or super-aggressive space takers will be low in both, because they operate on their own so often. Next into the pie is Opening, which also complements Entrying. This one is based on opening kills and attempts to show the players most often involved in early-round duels. If a player is high in both openers and traded deaths, it suggests plenty of early-round tumbles as a pack whereas an aggressive lurker might score high in Opening but low in Entrying. It's important to stress that this is about showing what a player does most often, and not really about how good they are at doing it. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen will have a high entering score thanks to how often he is traded as the bomb-site entry, but other players may do it with cleaner movement or a higher success rate and end up with a lower score. We are showing stylistic tendencies, not a player's overall skill. The opposite of Opening is Clutching, based on how often a player is in clutches (last alive  %) and how often they win them (clutch points). Clutches are pretty rare, so this is a metric that always benefits from large samples sizes, but for people who wanted a per-round version of the total clutches leaderboard here it is. Then we have Sniping, a simple one based on Scout and AWP kills, which is calculated slightly differently to make hybrid and secondary AWPers orange, primarys green, and pure rifles red. Finally, Utility is based on flashbang usage, flashbang assists, and overall utility damage to ensure flowers are handed out to specialists like Aleksi ""Aleksib"" Virolainen and Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire. Now we hand it over to you. Play around with the 22 new metrics, including trading stats, clutching, and how often a player finds an opener with a sniper, and learn something new about the players at the top and bottom of the scene.",21-8-2024 13:00,1724238000000
Dramatic r3salt-clax swap finalized moments before 9 Pandas' RMR qualifier campaign,https://www.hltv.org/news/39674/dramatic-r3salt-clax-swap-finalized-moments-before-9-pandas-rmr-qualifier-campaign,"In a series of twists and turns, the trade of r3salt and clax was first canceled and then finalized moments before 9 Pandas were due to play in a Shanghai Major qualifier. On Saturday, Aurora and 9 Pandas announced the trade of Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov and Timur ""clax"" Sabirov between the two sides. The situation was already charged enough with the Aurora organization and players insinuating r3salt had attempted to leave behind their backs, but the story didn't end there. In a dramatic twist, Aurora stated on Wednesday morning that the trade had been canceled on the previous day over the ""non-fulfillment of all agreed-upon terms,"" and that the two players were to return to their former teams. This left 9 Pandas scrambling for a solution at the last minute, as they were due to play with r3salt in the European closed qualifier leading up to the Perfect World Shanghai Major RMRs later on the same day of the announcement. In a happy ending, the two sides have now come to a new agreement to finalize the trade, after all, just moments before 9 Pandas' first match in the RMR qualifier against Insilio was due to start. In a statement about the situation, 9 Pandas only said that the original problem that caused the trade to be revoked was ""not financial, but in communication"" and that a non-disclosure agreement prevents them from disclosing the exact details. ""Despite the fact that the initial conditions of the transfer could not be met due to a number of hitches, today we were able to offer an alternative solution that satisfied both clubs,"" 9 Pandas said.",21-8-2024 14:29,1724243340000

Despite being the highest-ranked team in Closed Qualifier A, ENCE got off on the wrong foot in the tournament and fell to KOI and UNiTY in best-of-one games. These results only add to a disappointing start to the season from Lukas ""gla1ve"" Rossander's team, who lost to PARIVISION in the CCT Season 2 Europe Series 7 quarter-finals and couldn't make it out of the Europe open qualifiers for IEM Rio.

OG have upset and eliminated HEROIC from BLAST Premier Fall Showdown after securing a 2-0 win in their opening series (13-10 Anubis, 13-11 Nuke). Christoffer ""Chr1zN"" Storgaard and Christian ""Buzz"" Andersen's additions have breathed new life into an OG roster that has struggled to contest top opposition in the past year and spiraled down the rankings, dropping from around the top 10 to a fringe top 30-40 team. The Danish captain's move from MOUZ NXT is showing early promise in turning that around, however, with the team making it through the Europe open qualifier for IEM Rio, and now casting HEROIC out of the Showdown. The defeat adds to a downtrodden period for the Norwegian organization, which has struggled with visa issues for Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov and is on a streak of poor results with a Play-in elimination at IEM Cologne and group stage exit at YaLLa Compass before the break. ""It was a rough match, and to be honest, we just didn't wake up for the first map, the first half, especially,"" a dejected Eetu ""sAw"" Saha said in a post-match interview. ""It went without us being there fully, mentally, people weren't really able to find solutions. Almost everything we did was out of our control, and they were able to punish it. ""It's super disappointing to go out so fast, especially since Cologne, how it went, and that gave us some extra time to practice and now we are not able to show any of that, going out so fast. It's a sad situation. There are so many problems, like by the looks of it coming into these officials with what we need to fix. Sure there are some close maps, but then you look at the rounds and it shouldn't even be this close. We should be able to capitalize on way more situations. Congrats to OG on the win, but there is no way that any team should be able to punish us with these kinds of plays, so often at least."" It wasn't a pretty series for Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski's men as they arrived on the server looking out of sorts, with a lack of coordination, teamplay, and awareness of gaps on display for much of the series, but particularly so in a disastrous 2-10 T side on Anubis. That blowout proved too large a deficit to overcome despite a recovery effort in the second half, and an equally poor start on Nuke, down 1-8, was again not one that HEROIC could pull back from as they fell just short of forcing overtime in the second half.",21-8-2024 21:22,1724268120000

The European closed qualifiers for the Perfect World Shanghai Major RMRs played out the first qualification matches today, with four teams sealing RMR berths. SAW and Cloud9, two names many expected to see at the RMRs, made it out of closed qualifier A, whilst Sangal and SINNERS secured their spots through qualifier B, with the Czech side surprising with their form. Tomáš ""oskar"" Šťastný put up absolutely stellar numbers across four maps to ensure SINNERS breezed through the qualifier in commanding fashion, such that the Czech squad racked up a 52-13 aggregate round score against solid tier-two opposition. Sangal, the other team to make it out of qualifier B, had a tougher time. The team has been in excellent form in tier-two in recent months, winning the last two CCT Season 2 Europe events, but needed overtime to get the win over BC.Game and were run very close by BLEED in both maps of their qualification series. Ultimately, the strong showings of Samet ""jottAAA"" Köklü were enough to get Sangal over the line in the close maps. In qualifier A, SAW confidently secured their RMR berth with minimal fuss, backing up their Cologne run by showing they were a cut above their closed qualifier opposition. Permitta pushed SAW close on Nuke in their qualification bout, but other than that, Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing, João ""story"" Vieira and Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto had no problem blowing away every opponent in their path. Cloud9 had perhaps the shakiest run of all, benefitting from a kind draw against a Johnny Speeds side playing with a stand-in before being run close by Passion UA. Things were toughest of all for Kirill ""Boombl4"" Mikhailov's men in the qualification match against 9 Pandas. Despite playing with a brand-new addition in Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov, 9 Pandas pushed Cloud9 all the way on Inferno before spanking them 13-1 on Anubis, setting up a decider. Cloud9 once again managed to eke out a narrow win on the decider, ensuring an RMR berth after some hard-fought matches. The resurgent form of Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov will be a promising sign for Cloud9, their star rifler a key component of the victory over 9 Pandas.",22-8-2024 16:35,1724337300000

Ninjas in Pyjamas have been sent packing from the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown after a 2-1 loss to AMKAL in the Round of 16. The result is all the more striking given that the Russian team played with its head coach and was coming off a nine-match losing streak, during which it had lost to two academy squads, including NIP's Young Ninjas. AMKAL, who turned to Svyatoslav ""svyat"" Dovbakh after benching Daniil ""Sdaim"" Tupov earlier this month, will move on to face OG in the next round of the tournament. OG pulled off their own upset on Wednesday as they beat HEROIC in just two maps. It was a rematch of the messy Copenhagen Major RMR Overpass game, which AMKAL won after three overtimes. Tonight's match was just as chaotic (but with two more maps), and casters Mohan ""launders"" Govindasamy and Conner ""Scrawny"" Girvan couldn't help but burst out laughing at the succession of comedic moments. After losing back-to-back games in the RMR closed qualifier, AMKAL came out looking revitalized and cruised to a 13-3 victory on their map pick of Inferno. Ninjas in Pyjamas responded by winning Ancient by the same scoreline, with Fredrik ""REZ"" Sterner putting in a 2.05 rating. The Swedish player came up clutch in the decider map of Vertigo in a 1v3 situation as his team was facing series point in overtime.

A quick 13-2 on Metizport's Ancient pick could have made for a quick 2-0, but it got twisted for Complexity on Vertigo as they needed an overtime to break the tie after 24 rounds. It was smooth sailing, though, as they won it 4-0 to end 16-12. Falcons also needed overtime on their map pick against M80.

Monte end ENCE's seven-Major streak in 1-2 round of the EU RMR's closed qualifier,https://www.hltv.org/news/39686/monte-end-ences-seven-major-streak-in-1-2-round-of-the-eu-rmrs-closed-qualifier,"Johnny Speeds were also eliminated in overtime on the decider map of their series with Rebels. ENCE, a mainstay in top-tier Counter-Strike, have been knocked out of the Perfect World Shanghai Major EU RMR Closed Qualifier by Monte in a three-map series. The Finnish organization will therefore not field a team at a Major for the first time since they missed FACEIT Major London in 2018, ending an attendance streak of seven in a row. The series started with Olek ""hades"" Miskiewicz single-handedly smashing his former team on Ancient. He went 21-2 to earn a 2.27 rating in the 13-1 thrashing. The Pole was benched from ENCE in May to make way for academy graduate Paavo ""podi"" Heiskanen, who ended up being his team's highest-rated player in the series, with a 1.19 by the end of it. It was not enough, however, as despite winning a close Anubis 13-11, the Mirage series decider went to the Polish-majority squad, 13-7. ENCE, who lost the team lead by Eetu ""sAw"" Saha and Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer that won the organization's only trophy in the past five years, counted on magic and heroics to stay relevant early on in the year with a playoffs finish at IEM Katowice and a Major appearance in Copenhagen. Now, it appears that ENCE's pixie dust has run out as the team's discards, Paweł ""dycha"" Dycha and hades, have gotten one over them at a crucial juncture. Elsewhere in the closed qualifier's Group A, BC.Game and Rhyno were eliminated. BC.Game had won their opener against ECLOT, but couldn't cut it against Sangal, GamerLegion, and TSM. Rhyno had surprised with an OT victory against GamerLegion in the opening round, but also suffered took three Ls in a row against BLEED, UNiTY, and B8. Over in the B qualifier, one of the year's feel-good stories came crashing as Johnny Speeds were eliminated in a third-map overtime by Rebels. The Swedish team, who had been on a great run of form leading up to the RMR and even bootcamped at NIP's facilities in Stockholm in preparation for the qualifier, fielded a stand-in for Hugo ""chawzyyy"" Günther and couldn't make it through. Qiang, who came into the qualifier after losing support from their organization, PERA, were also eliminated in the 1-2 pool. They were taken out by Insilio in two maps. Sashi also survived to reach the 2-2 pool and will, therefore, play the deciding round of the qualifier as they took out ARCRED in a three-mapper that went the distance on the Inferno decider, 13-11.",23-8-2024 14:48,1724417280000

The 2-1 pool matches in the closed qualifiers for the Europe RMRs have come to an end, seeing ECLOT, PARIVISION and UNiTY come through Closed Qualifier A and 9 Pandas, BIG and Passion UA through Closed Qualifier B. BIG, the only top 20 team still trying to make it out of the qualifiers after SAW had gone 3-0, came back from a map down to beat Permitta 2-1. Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz's troops breathed a sigh of relief as the series' second map, Mirage, came down to overtime before they demolished the Polish side on Nuke. Passion UA edged past OG in a three-map series, while 9 Pandas defeated fellow Russian side Nemiga in just two maps with a great performance from their newest signing, Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov, who averaged a 1.32 rating in Closed Qualifier B. Over in the A qualifier, ECLOT were the first team to make it out of the 2-1 pool as they upset BLEED 2-1, the same scoreline by which PARIVISION beat GamerLegion. Shortly afterward, world No.99 UNiTY beat KOI 2-1 in stunning fashion, adding to the Czech contingent in Shanghai.

The Closed Qualifier A 2-2 pool saw three high-octane bouts between teams expected to make it to the RMR before the event. B8 were the first to qualify after a 13-1 demolition of Monte on Mirage, while TSM followed shortly after with their win over KOI. The final match was a clash between Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović's BLEED and GamerLegion, and the Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson-led team came out on top after a spirited 3-12 comeback on Mirage. The failure to qualify is a tough pill to swallow for BLEED, with their Serbian coach branding the exit ""embarrassing"" in a post-match tweet. Closed Qualifier B was a more subdued affair, as the favorites had already secured their spots at the RMR. OG were bested by Sashi in the biggest clash of the round to miss out on their second consecutive Major, while Rebels won the Polish derby against Permitta to secure a spot.

The EVPs and Best Five of IEM Cologne 2024,https://www.hltv.org/news/39679/the-evps-and-best-five-of-iem-cologne-2024,"iM once again takes the top EVP in an event where Vitality win and ZywOo takes the MVP. IEM Cologne 2024 delivered in spades, justifying its status as one of the most prestigious non-Major tournaments with the fantastic underdog run of SAW and culminating in Vitality winning their first trophy of the year. You would have bet your house on Mathieu ""ZywOo"" Herbaut winning the MVP if you knew that Vitality would take the trophy home, but it ended up being very close: ZywOo had a slow game in groups against FaZe, and only secured the MVP after hitting a 1.34 rating in the semi-final and final. The team effort behind Vitality and Natus Vincere's runs to the final means we are handing out plenty of Extremely Valuable Player (EVP) awards, so let's not waste any more of your time. We start with Mihai ""iM"" Ivan. Just like in Paris more than a year ago, iM put together a MVP-level performance only to falter in the final against ZywOo and Vitality. The much-maligned Romanian opener has experienced an upswing as of late, and ended Cologne with 108.7 damage in NAVI's round wins and a 1.50 CT rating. In the year since Paris, iM averaged a 1.04 rating. In the last three months, that figure has skyrocketed to 1.14. The narrative around NAVI has been one of a fantastic team with a strong tactical identity, but sometimes lacking the firepower of the superteams in the international scene. If iM can maintain this form, that narrative has a very early expiry date. Shahar ""flameZ"" Shushan came the closest out of any Vitality member to toppling ZywOo's record of taking the MVP in every Big Event tournament he has ever won. He was ahead of ZywOo after groups having starred against FaZe and MOUZ, but in the arena just fell short of securing his first ever MVP. Still, he ended just 0.04 rating points behind ZywOo on 1.29 in Vitality's map wins, and was similarly impressive in round wins (1.00 KPRW, 105.6 ADRW). Speaking of debut MVPs, Valeriy ""b1t"" Vakhovskiy grabbed his first at Esports World Cup and was set to go back-to-back after spearheading Natus Vincere's stomps past Group A and the win over MOUZ in semi-finals. He ends up being fourth in the list, failing to improve his case in the final — and hurting it on Nuke with a 1-11 K-D start in a map that eventually went Vitality's way in overtime — but he still ends with a very strong EVP. Lotan ""Spinx"" Giladi, the No. 5 player of 2023, has endured a quieter 2024 but at Cologne he stepped up when it mattered to grab his second EVP in three events. His clutching was impactful, winning six total 1vX situations including two 1v3s. His 4K 1v2 against Natus Vincere on Nuke was particularly impressive for a player whose temperament in the big moments has been questioned. Where to start with G2 and Ilya ""m0NESY"" Osipov? The Flash and company had a peculiar tournament, dropping to the lower bracket only to demolish Spirit, Astralis, and SAW with a 78-15 record in their six map wins (88-28 overall). That left all of their raw statistics fairly inflated, but the difference with m0NESY is that he put up a hell of a fight against MOUZ in the arena as his team around him faltered. Justinas ""jL"" Lekavicius had rightfully earned a reputation as a big game player after the Major, Spring Final, and Esports World Cup all saw him go up a level under the bright lights. That narrative took a hit here — he had a poor final by his standards, ending bottom of the 10-player scoreboard at a 0.95 rating — but his superb group stage and impactful clutches against MOUZ still proved his value to NAVI's run. SAW and Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto were the talk of the town after their run to the semi-finals, a stretch that featured wins over G2 (No. 5) and The MongolZ (No. 11) and was backed up in the quarter-final victory over FaZe (No. 6). ewjerkz was poor in SAW's losses, but by far their most impressive in the wins: He averaged a 1.41 rating (with Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing on a 1.26) in the six map wins and 1.09 KPR in round wins, enough for an EVP. Dan ""apEX"" Madesclaire didn't get his EVP but he is recognised in the Best Five. Vitality earned a staggering 66.7% T side win rate in Germany, a clear sign of both their firepower and depth of apEX's calling. In terms of roles, flameZ fits in as a CT anchor with b1t, which means one of him or iM will have to tweak their T roles. Given flameZ's 1.37 T rating, and iM's 1.01, we'll probably have flameZ on map control and iM as the aggressive lurker for a nicely balanced squad. Roland ""ultimate"" Tomkowiak was almost unknown before the summer break, but was scouted by Russel ""Twistzz"" Van Dulken and identified as the aggressive AWPer to alleviate Liquid's early-round issues. At Cologne, he has delivered the openers required (0.15 overall, 0.06 with snipers) but, more surprisingly, star level fragging output (0.81 KPR, 3rd). Unfortunately, he could not quite crack the high bar required for a group stage EVP after he disappeared in the crucial decider against FaZe (where Liquid were 11-1 up). He also earned his high numbers against FURIA and Complexity, opposition outside of the top ten. MOUZ, like HEROIC did in 2023, once again had a good team result but lacked a standout individual (with Ádám ""torzsi"" Torzsás coming closest) to crack the EVP list. FaZe had a similar story, where Robin ""ropz"" Kool and David ""frozen"" Čerňanský came close but did not quite stand out enough on a personal level. G2's rifling trio of Mario ""malbsMd"" Samayoa, Nemanja ""huNter-"" Kovač, and Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač all recorded bonkers numbers in the lower bracket demolition job, but fell off in playoffs. When you split the value for the LB stomps in four, since the quartet all did so well, only m0NESY did enough for an EVP. apEX had a run of three EVP-level maps starting in the semi-final against SAW and carrying onto his overtime fragging display on Nuke in map one of the final, but was too inconsistent outside of those three maps. ZywOo and m0NESY both add to their No. 1 case as Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets recorded his worst-ever LAN event.",23-8-2024 23:21,1724448060000

"chopper: ""Changes are unlikely before and after Shanghai""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39689/chopper-changes-are-unlikely-before-and-after-shanghai,"Spirit's in-game leader spoke at length about their IEM Cologne debacle and what they're doing to get back on their feet after the tough start to the season. To say the start of the second season has not gone according to plan for Spirit would be an understatement. Fresh off a victory at BLAST Premier Spring Final, Danil ""donk"" Kryshkovets and company entered the new season as the No. 1 team, but their form disappeared in a puff of smoke as they bombed out of the Esports World Cup and IEM Cologne after the break. The latter exit was a particular cause for concern, as Spirit only won eight rounds over three out of the four map losses they suffered against The MongolZ and G2 in Germany, and produced some early calls for changes in the team. Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov all but ruled out the possibility of roster changes in the near future in an interview with HLTV, going as far as to say they are ""unlikely to happen both before and after Shanghai, no matter what happens."" While participating in media obligations for BetBoom Dacha Belgrade he delved in-depth into the reasons behind Spirit's horrendous Cologne exit, touching on issues with the team's atmosphere as well as his leadership as he took responsibility for their disappearance. You can read the full interview below, in which chopper also spoke about Spirit's consecutive losses to the new G2, Valve's decision to ban Snap Tap and remove jump-throw binds, and the upcoming campaign at BetBoom Dacha Belgrade: This interview was conducted in Russian and later translated by Russian-speaking HLTV staff. I want to start with IEM Cologne, an extremely unfortunate result for your team. What went wrong? In Cologne, we were a little disunited as a team. We had issues that we didn't solve before the event; it started after the break. And in Cologne, all of those small issues with relations or with the game showed and hit the team hard. After the tournament, we tried to solve everything, and we'll see how it will go at this event. You said that there were issues regarding the game and relations between the players. What do you think was the key factor? As for me, the greater factor was that I, as a captain, couldn't put the team in a lighter vibe so the players would be relaxed. I was thinking more about the game, not the atmosphere in the team. I think it was the biggest problem for me at the event. You lost to Mongolz in the opening match and to G2 in the elimination game. Which loss hit you harder? Both losses were hard to take. I'd say the second one was more of a knockout for us. In the first game we were at least playing, even though we had difficulties, but in the second game we didn't even join the server as a team. So it was a knockout game for us. You lost to G2 in Cologne and at the Esports World Cup. How do you explain losing to them twice? Is it their stronger new roster, or was it more about your form? I think there are several different factors. Firstly, I can say that they have a strong roster for sure, their players are in their peak form. They're charged, they have a light mood, no problems, and everything is well. They're still not winning events, but it's much easier for them to play now with malbsMd and Snax than with HooXi and nexa, it's 100%. As for us, there are also different factors. At EWC, we won the first map, lost Mirage, and not sure what the third map was… But there we had certain issues due to which we lost. I believe they were in good form, but we also played the third map terribly. We fought there, at least. Yes, we lost the first map disastrously, fought on Nuke, and on map three, what happened happened. In Cologne, we didn't even start playing from map one. In Riyadh, you can break down the game and talk about rounds and mechanical mistakes. If you watch the Cologne game, there's nothing to analyze. Spirit was absent from the server. After the win in Katowice, and overall considering the high ceiling that the team has shown, you can often hear people talking about changes in the roster. To put it straight, are changes in the team possible before Shanghai? Or do you rule out such a possibility? I think changes in Spirit are unlikely to happen both before and after Shanghai. You always need to give it an adequate look. We have a very young team. The backbone of the team, in my view, is the IGL, AWP, and the star player. And this core has been playing together for only half a year, it's so little. Also, some players are young. So I think that changes are unlikely after Shanghai, no matter what happens, because most players here haven't reached their peak form. And you need to look at the season: We won Katowice, then we reached playoffs everywhere with this young roster, and before the break we won a big event. It means that it wasn't like we entered Katowice and thanks to donk or peeker's advantage won the event. No, we won another event four months later. The team is putting in work and fixing the mistakes. Yes, we have a tough period right now, after the break we couldn't gain form, we had issues with the atmosphere within the team. But I think with proper work from everyone - and we're working a lot on this - everything will be fine, so it's unlikely for any changes to happen. Do I understand it right that you look at your performance as if the glass is half full and not half empty? In a sense that you're happy with how your young team has shown itself and what events you won, but if something doesn't work, it's still within your expectations. Do you talk through the issue of expectations with the team? That you probably need to have a more realistic outlook? That's a good question, because what happened in Cologne is that we had wrong expectations of ourselves. I don't know about the guys and can't speak for them, but I had expectations that we're a super team, we won two events, we're tier 1, tier S, and we need to reach the semi-finals at minimum. And I believe those thoughts of mine hurt the team. I'm supposed to have an understanding that we are a young team… And I do have it. I remembered it the entire season when we were working together. But after the break, I didn't manage to find these questions within myself. But now the team helps me and I look at it with a more clear view. So yes, we need to look at everything that happened as the glass is half full. We're a super young team. And donk's showing in Katowice was not his last performance, he will show an even better one. We have one of the best snipers and two great anchors. If we were not in form at that moment, we just need to step up, believe in each other, and everything will be well. Because we work a lot, spend a lot of time with each other, and it will have an impact. I presume hally has a significant weight in these conversations you mentioned. But who else is involved? Actually, a lot of people work with our team. Our coach, psychologist, and manager can always share their opinion. Our CEO also works with us, he also helps us sometimes. Team Spirit are doing everything, and I thank them for that. They help us with all sorts of issues: visas, travel, apartments, and so on. A lot of people work with our roster, and we just need to appreciate what people do around us and show a good game. Speaking again of hally, can you tell us why he was absent during BLAST Groups? hally had an illness, which is why he couldn't attend. But during BLAST he tried to help, he stayed in touch. But after that he got better and came to work with us at Cologne. Your team received an invite to IEM Rio but decided to skip the event. Can you tell us what went into that decision? We have people who are responsible for all of our travel, these are our manager, coach, and CEO. Honestly, I'm not very involved in this, but the guys said that we  would have a lot of events, and they didn't want us to get burned out before the Major. For the first time, this team is playing so many LAN events in a row - not just online, but on LAN. We had EWC, a week off, BLAST groups, five days later we had Cologne. We dropped out early, which is why we had a bigger break, but after that we're having one week at BetBoom Dacha, straight after that we're going to EPL, a week off, then we might have EPL playoffs, depending on the results. Straight after EPL there will be BLAST. The events go one after another, without a break. And to go to Rio, you need to spend two days on travel, you can't play praccs really. I'm expressing my opinion, not sure what came into the guys' decision, but I think it makes sense if we don't want to get exhausted and burned out and show the best we can at the events we will be playing. Valve recently updated the game, removing Snap Tap and jump throws. What do you think of this change and how was it taken by your team? Snap Tap didn't really affect us because we only got Snap Tap keyboards after Cologne. We looked around, everyone was using them. Some got really boosted by it, some did not, but it's not the point. We actually decided to give those keyboards a try, to practice them a bit. And we were playing with them for four or five days, everything is awesome, we really got into it. Cool feature! Boom, it got disabled. Damn, but we only got it… But whatever. Half of the team tried and I did like it, but it doesn't make a lot of difference for us, we didn't get used to it a lot. But I personally enjoyed it a lot. I tried it and was like, damn, Snap Tap is great! My player model is super nimble! When they removed it, I was like, how to play again? My model is slow again… But I only played three or four days, I don't think it will be significant. Regarding jump throw and run throw, it's quite surprising. My opinion is that if it comes down to pressing two or three buttons, and it depends on your skill, it's cool. Teams will indeed start to think about getting some grenade nerd to throw some of these nades, because not everyone will be able to do it. It will require more skill than just pointing and throwing. On the other hand, I don't mind jump throw. It's convenient, you don't need to practice anything, you just point and throw. So I'm fine with both ways, it's not crucial. The most important is for Valve to make up their mind on the matter. If they want it to be banned forever, then let it be like that from now on so people could train it. Give people time to show who's great at nades, and who's going to be failing them. But now most of the community doesn't like it being removed. Now there are RMR qualifiers, and half of the teams are struggling with grenades. Then just return them ASAP, in two or three days. But I just want stability, so we, as players, know if we wouldn't be playing without these binds for long, or we would be able to go back since most don't like it being removed. BetBoom Dacha. Last time you lost to MOUZ, this time you and them are also the main favorites. What do you expect from this event, and how important is it for you to perform well here? I just don't expect anything from this event. The most important thing for us at this event is to join the server and enjoy playing with each other. No matter the preparation, whether opponents know how we play or not, we just have to show what we're capable of. Because the last two events there were plenty of moments where we simply didn't show how we're able to play. Not only we didn't show our best, we didn't even show our normal level. For me it's important to just play CS and enjoy the game with each other. Neither maximum nor minimum, just normal. What place we finish doesn't matter. Everyone understands within the team that if we play our normal game, and just enjoy the game, we can win this tournament.",24-8-2024 13:28,1724498880000
Complexity's woes continue with Showdown exit,https://www.hltv.org/news/39692/complexitys-woes-continue-with-showdown-exit,"The North American side notched just one series win over Metizport before faltering to Falcons. The quarter-final clash between Complexity and Falcons has drawn to a close, seeing Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's men emerge victorious after dropping their map pick of Nuke to kick off the series. For Complexity, this result adds to the team's tally of early exits since the conclusion of the player break. Although Jonathan ""EliGE"" Jablonowski and co. finished the first half of the year on a high note, the team has failed to find similar success since returning to action, with their most notable showing so far being their 9-12th finish at IEM Cologne. Complexity's members are now set to return to North America for a brief reprieve from their six weeks in Europe, before crossing the pond once again for their next outing at ESL Pro League Season 20. Falcons, meanwhile, now sit one series victory away from reaching the BLAST Premier Fall Final in Copenhagen, with the international side set to face the victor of Virtus.pro's game against BIG in their qualifying match. As for the series itself, Complexity got off to a solid start on Falcons's pick of Nuke, capitalizing off a 9-3 CT-side to snatch the map 13-6. Complexity failed to find similar success on Vertigo, as it was Falcons who hit the ground running in the first half, accruing an 8-4 lead on the defense. Although the North Americans managed to keep things close in the second half, sharp individual plays from Snappi kept Complexity just out of reach, leading them to lose their pick 10-13. Anubis saw another strong first half from Falcons, who carved out another 8-4 lead despite missing out on the first pistol round. After missing out on the second pistol round, Complexity were left with no room for error, allowing Falcons to quickly end the map with a 13-5 scoreline to send the North Americans packing.",24-8-2024 18:48,1724518080000
9z and paiN triumph in BB Dacha Play-in openers,https://www.hltv.org/news/39693/9z-and-pain-triumph-in-bb-dacha-play-in-openers,"Falcons and BetBoom stare elimination in the face after early trips to the lower bracket. 9z and paiN have claimed victory in their opening Play-in matches at BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2, beating Falcons and BetBoom, respectively, to advance to the upper final of Group A where a spot in the main event is on the line. It will be a rematch of the teams' meeting just two weeks ago at IEM Cologne, where Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt's side reverse-swept 9z to eliminate them in the lower bracket of Group A. paiN then moved past The MongolZ but fell short of making the playoffs to a red-hot G2. The Brazilian team's mission to bed João ""snow"" Vinicius into anchor roles and stabilize after losing Vinicius ""n1ssim"" Pereira following their Copenhagen Major run continues to bear fruit, with a 2-0 win over Cloud9 in BLAST Fall Showdown while in Serbia for BetBoom Dacha offering an injection of confidence ahead of the team's opening match against BetBoom. The Russian team got off to a torrid start to the series, going down 4-8 on their Mirage pick and losing it 8-13, with Pavel ""s1ren"" Ogloblin and Aleksandr ""KaiR0N-"" Anashkin managing five kills apiece. The latter had a resurgence in a back-and-forth Vertigo, where BetBoom recovered from a 6-9 deficit to steal the map 13-10, but a 1.79-rated showing from Lucas ""nqz"" Soares on the Anubis decider proved too much to overcome as paiN eventually closed out the map to take the series. 9z have been in a purple patch of form of their own in recent months, finishing top-four at IEM Dallas, winning FiReLEAGUE Global Finals, and fighting through the Play-in of IEM Cologne before their elimination by paiN. Maximiliano ""max"" Gonzalez's troops showed that same form upon arrival in Belgrade, 1.98 and 1.51-rated showings from Antonio ""MartinezSa"" Martinez and Matias ""HUASOPEEK"" Ibañez Hernandez powering 9z to a 12-round streak over Falcons to win Mirage, 13-5. Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's side were equally as dominant on Dust2, rolling over the South American team on the T side 9-3 before closing 13-7, but couldn't convert a 10-6 lead on the Nuke decider as a fantastic T side from 9z saw them win seven straight to close the series and cast Falcons down to the lower bracket.",24-8-2024 19:11,1724519460000
"r3salt: ""I've moved to 9 Pandas to f*** even harder than I do now""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39694/r3salt-ive-moved-to-9-pandas-to-f-even-harder-than-i-do-now,"The new 9 Pandas rifler shared a number of details surrounding his hectic transfer from Aurora. In one of the more bizarre player transfers in recent memory, Aurora's young gun Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov was swapped with domestic rival 9 Pandas's Timur ""clax"" Sabirov, but only after a back-and-forth maneuver that saw r3salt briefly return to Aurora's bench before finally being allowed to transfer within hours of the start of 9 Pandas's RMR qualifier campaign. Even before the transfer had gone through, fissures between r3salt and his former teammates were apparent, with Aleksandr ""KENSI"" Gurkin and the organization insinuating that r3salt had attempted to leave behind the team's back. After completing the transfer, 9 Pandas managed to secure their place in the Perfect World Shanghai Major with a 3-1 in Closed Qualifier B, and the Russian side have now arrived in Belgrade to compete in BetBoom Dacha Season 2. Ahead of his team's first match in Belgrade, r3salt discussed his perspective on the chaotic transfer in an interview with HLTV, shedding light on his issues with Aurora, his feelings when it seemed the deal would fall apart, his hopes for his new team, and a potential face-off versus his former team, among other topics. This interview was conducted in Russian and later translated by Russian-speaking HLTV staff. Recently a player swap was announced between Aurora and 9 Pandas involving you. Aurora commented it in a way that implied that you wanted to leave the team behind their backs. What can you say about this? First of all, thank god the deal came through. Secondly, I've already said this, but there was no business done behind their backs. Initially, after two months of intense playing – we played online, then in Australia – I couldn't quite get how the training process would be set up. And when we got to work on that, I immediately started to tell the organization what didn't work for me, and a little after to the coach and some of the teammates. As for Norwi and KENSI speaking out… They knew nothing, but since they're so close with the organization's management, it sounds very silly of them. Because if the management knows, they must know as well. I remember reading about Norwi being in a restaurant with me, just two of us eating and chatting, and he thought whether I would tell him that I want to go to 9 Pandas or not. So he knew. On Twitter, Aurora published KENSI's comment where he spoke of you along the lines of 'rats that are fleeing the ship.' Why do you think they posted that? Could it be a misunderstanding, or are they trying to bad mouth you? I can understand the organization completely, they're just riding the hype train. One post after another, and everyone eats this, it's getting reposted, so obviously they would continue doing this. But they calmed down a bit, KENSI and Norwi did as well. But at first, there was so much shit. Even in the group chat when I was leaving, there were only curse words said about me, while I talked normally. Like, I share some reasonable thoughts on why things went this way, problems, why I left. I apologized for some things going wrong, and why I decided to go here. But they didn't want to take it sensibly and were only telling me to go to hell. That's it. You wanted to go to 9 Pandas, but Aurora is higher than 9 Pandas in the HLTV ranking. The team also had some small successes, particularly, when you won the online Skyesports Masters. From the outside, it can seem like a step back, but how do you look at it? Small successes tell nothing at all, I think about the prospects. I've moved to 9 Pandas to f*** even harder than I do now. Actually, if Aurora's roster developed, it could possibly be a top 10 team in the world. Me and the coach both had that opinion, we talked about this a lot, but because some players didn't work hard enough on the things that are important, it was not happening. So I wanted to move to a different team where I know how the process is set up. From day one, I could see that it's indeed the way I want it to be. And I think that after some time we will naturally be higher than Aurora in the ranking. So your main issue with Aurora was work ethic and the overall process that was set up there. Can you share more about that? Honestly, I don't want to get specific. But I saw people in comments saying that r3salt doesn't fit the vibe of the team. And I was like 'Okay, they watch the vlogs, it's just bullshit which I never even watched.' But one could think of something, like I walk in my headphones, I don't give a shit about anyone, etc… yet the vibe in the team was okay. We talked, we were all friends, family – no doubt. So my main issue was with the training process, and it was the reason for the move. Not long before the start of the RMR qualifiers the deal that was supposed to include the move fell through. But just before 9 Pandas' first match at the qualifier it was announced that the swap had happened. How did you live through that moment? When you learned about the deal falling through, what was your reaction? That was the worst night and morning of my life. I was messaging everyone that I felt like shit, and I really did. I didn't know what to do. I thought that the following day and following couple of months I would be out of business, because I would be benched and because they would want to punish me, so to say. I didn't know what plans to build. I really thought that I should go out in the night and find a hobo to stab me, and that's it. The following morning I had the same thoughts. But I was sitting on the first floor with spirit 9 Pandas Sports Director, there was another round of negotiations with Aurora. And then he starts smiling and lifting his finger, pointing up. And I understand that 'F***, seems like I need to go start warming up.' I got so f***ing charged. Played an hour and a half on deathmatch, after that a warmup pracc, and then the match. Those are indescribable emotions, that back and forth was just crazy. I had an entire week like that. All the guys in Aurora knew I would be leaving, but I didn't know how to even look them in the eyes. It wasn't comfortable for me. I acted nice, said hi, hit the high fives – just being polite. And then all the shit came out. What made you take this entire situation so closely? What consequences did you imagine it could have had? They would ask for an insane buyout for me, and some changes happening in some proper teams would be a great miracle. Even though there's some shuffle season opening up, it's not 100% that someone would be making changes. It could have been great if someone picked me up, but I couldn't count on that. This is why I had those thoughts. I wanted to play for 9 Pandas, and it fell through, and I thought 'What am I gonna do next?' I was already messaging harumi, saying 'F***, just pick me up as an analyst, I would be analyzing the RMRs with you and just chill…' Yeah, I had thoughts like that. During that ill-fated night, were you involved in the negotiations in any form? There were also claims that you supposedly bought yourself out, is it related to reality in any way? No, I was not involved in the negotiations in any way. I was comparing myself with my followers because I knew literally nothing. I was just sitting and waiting to be told that everything was cool and I would be playing. But at first, I was hearing 'Everything is bad, you won't be playing,' and I'm like, 'I'm in Aurora, great.' As for buying myself out, it's just a clickbait. I don't know why people post this, where do I even get that kind of money? Someone says that I took out a bunch of microcredits, sold someone… No, I would not have money like that, it's all 9 Pandas. And I thank them for that. You have already managed to reach the RMRs with 9 Pandas, you won the online qualifier with a 3-1 record. How did it go? Did you guys feel confident as a team? Or were you a little nervous since you just joined the team and it's already an important tournament? My goal is to just reach the Major, and if you want to do so, you need to go through the closed quals. And it's just a game. I played as usual, can't speak for the other guys. But iDISBALANCE was yelling in the first two games, and to me, it seemed like he was a little agitated. As for myself, I was just playing the game and doing my job on the map, which led to success. You're now playing BetBoom Dacha, your team got here via the Closed Qualifier. Do you have any goals or expectations from this event? I don't know about the rest, but I just want to play CS. If we beat someone, great. Like when we played Cloud9 in the 2-0 bracket at the RMR qualifier, we were playing really well. There were plenty of moments where either team got lucky. At this event, we just want to show that we're on a proper level, not just a top 40 team like we are right now. After some time, there should be a different number on the rankings page. You said you wanted to beat someone… Would you want to play against Aurora? I don't care, to be honest. If it happens, it's probably going to be cool for the viewers. But for me, it's not a grudge match, just a game like all others. I will be just playing my game, and that's it.",24-8-2024 22:19,1724530740000

"FaZe, VP prevail in Showdown quarter-finals",https://www.hltv.org/news/39696/faze-vp-prevail-in-showdown-quarter-finals,"The matches to decide the last Fall Final attendees have now been determined. The quarter-finals of BLAST Premier Fall Showdown 2024 have wrapped up, seeing FaZe and Virtus.pro move past their respective opponents of paiN and BIG to earn their places in the two qualification series. FaZe are now poised to face off against OG for a shot at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen, with the latter side having beat HEROIC and AMKAL to set up the clash with Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's troops. Meanwhile, Virtus.pro will be squaring off against Falcons, who recovered from a rough start to their day with a loss to 9z at BetBoom Dacha Season 2 with a 2-1 victory over Complexity in the Fall Showdown. FaZe encountered little difficulty to start versus paiN, strolling through their opponent's pick of Anubis with a 13-5 scoreline. Their own map pick of Inferno proved to be far more difficult of an affair, as paiN's men emerged the victors in overtime, despite a whopping 31 kills from Robin ""ropz"" Kool. The tough loss on Inferno did little to mar FaZe's confidence however, as the international side quickly rebounded on their decider of Mirage, bagging another 13-5 scoreline to send paiN packing from the Fall Showdown. Virtus.pro's brawl with BIG served as the final match of the day, one that ended up being far closer than the match that preceded it. Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali's men made a game of BIG's pick of Ancient, crawling back from a 6-11 deficit to force overtime, only to fall at the final hurdle as the Germans locked it down 19-16 in double OT. Virtus.pro rebounded on their pick of Mirage, taking it 13-7 in a straightforward affair. Dust2 seemed like it would be going the way of BIG early on, as Johannes ""tabseN"" Wodarz and co. accrued an 8-1 lead on their CT-side. Unfortunately for BIG, the German side seemed to be a shell of themselves on the offense, garnering just two rounds as Virtus.pro roared ahead to take the map 13-10.",25-8-2024 01:48,1724543280000

"Magisk: ""Sometimes we only start playing proper CS in the elimination matches""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39698/magisk-sometimes-we-only-start-playing-proper-cs-in-the-elimination-matches,"Magisk spoke positively about Falcons' recent progress but noted they are still in a position where they need to play as much as possible to grind their way up. Falcons have experienced a modest uptick in form in recent weeks, whilst not always earning results commensurate with their improved play. At IEM Cologne they ran MOUZ close across a 1-2 series loss, took FaZe to overtime before being eliminated, and they just made it to the qualification match of BLAST Premier Fall Showdown by virtue of confident victories over M80 and Complexity. The beginning of Falcons' campaign at BetBoom Dacha began in familiar fashion, with the team playing reasonably well and running 9z close, but coming out on the wrong end of the result. Having bounced back with a comfortable win over BetBoom, Magisk sat down with HLTV to give his insight into the teams recent modest improvements, the reasons for the uptick, and his thoughts on his team's firepower. The 26-year-old was also asked about recent rumors of Nikola ""NiKo"" Kovač being close to joining the team for 2025, but did not give a straight answer either way. What are your thoughts after that game? It must be nice to get a convincing 2-0 victory. Obviously it's always nice when you win 2-0. I felt like we had it in control most of the match, it was a little rough at the beginning of T-side Nuke, but I think we adapted pretty well today, which was a good thing. We also did some good individual plays, but overall I feel like it was a pretty comfortable win. I'm just happy we are improving slowly, getting better from game to game, and also this is one of the reasons why we want to play as many official games as possible, to get to know each other and get to know how we should react, have a lot of learning from official games. That's where you learn the most, how you should react to certain situations and all these types of things. Right now, we're just trying to get as many official games under our belts, so we can get data about how we should improve. At the start of this Falcons roster, things were a little rough, but from the outside, it now seems you are starting to creep in the right direction. You are in the final of Showdown, you played pretty well in Cologne, you played well against MOUZ and could have won the first map against FaZe. Does it feel like that, like the progression is getting going now? Ever since we got dupreeh, I feel like it was the first time we could actually create a foundation and have the proper structure around the team to build up our tactics and playbook. From there, you just need a lot of official games to get to know each other and, in some way, get up to date with the meta. At the end of last year, me, Snappi and zonic missed the beginning of CS2 with official games, so we kind of had to catch up all the time. With the first edition of the team, I felt like that was impossible. Since we got Peter, that was the first time we felt we could build a team, a structure, and a playbook we could rely on. Since then we have been improving tournament to tournament, a little bit slowly, of course, but it is moving in the right direction. Against MOUZ in Cologne, we should probably have won that game. On the third map, Ancient, we had five rounds in a row where we could have broken their money, we had advantaged situations, and they made hero play after hero play. Sometimes that's what you need to convert those games. When we lose, we most of the time lose 1-2 and in close games, where we have the idea that if we just converted the advantageous situations we had, we could beat the best of the best. There's a long way from saying that to actually doing it, and that's what we're trying to do right now, find the consistency in the team and individually finding our plays. Obviously, we don't have a superstar, so it's difficult sometimes with the roles and all these types of things. We are all just trying to learn, there's a lot of people in new positions who have to learn a lot of things and get comfortable. As an example, maden is playing Conn for the first time in his career and there's a lot of learning lessons, about reactions, how to help people, how to take the space on the map, all these types of things. I think that's the process we have been going through, and also why it has been going a bit slow. But it's going in the right direction, which is the nice thing. What about dupreeh coming into the team allowed you to make this progression? Was it just having a more set five-man lineup, or is there something specifically he brings? Obviously, I love Peter, but I just think we needed a consistent five-man who could actually be professional in being there, all these types of things, and someone we could rely on. This is one of the reasons he was picked up, you can always count on dupreeh and count on him being a professional, someone you can trust in-game and outside of the server. We needed that in the team. We could have taken a gamble in getting a young talent, but sometimes you don't know what you're getting, and with all the rough times we were going through at the start of the team, we needed consistency and we needed to know what we could rely on. We felt it was a better choice to go with a veteran than a young talent, because we needed to get the foundation straight. How important are tournaments like this for a team in your position? There aren't all the top teams in attendance and you could put together a deep run. Do you see it that way, as a good tournament for a team in your stage? We were not supposed to play this tournament at the beginning, but after we couldn't qualify for the playoffs in Cologne we wanted to have more official games so we could get more data and prepare the journey for the RMR. Right now, we are in a position where we need to grind, we need to grind the ranking to stay at the top. It's a bit different from what we are used to, but that's the world we live in and we need to accept that. We are not at the level we want to be right now, which means we need to give everything, be able to look ourselves in the eye and say we gave 100%. If every other tier-two team is capable of playing tournament after tournament, then we need to put in the effort, and get the data we need from the official games to learn all the time. It's just what we needed, we needed to play more to get up in the rankings but also get the lessons learned, learned the hard way sometimes. That's why we're playing a tournament like this. There are a lot of games, a lot of opportunities, and a lot of best-of-threes. Recently the CS transfer rumour mill has been turning, and KRL said on stream that Falcons were looking to bring NiKo in for 2025. Have the team heard anything about this, have you had any discussions about these rumours? I'm here to focus on BetBoom and the BLAST Showdown, I'm not familiar with anything. I'm just focused on being present and being in the now. I cannot comment on rumours and stuff like this, so yeah, I'm here to just focus on BetBoom and BLAST Showdown. As a more general point, does the team feel in a good place in terms of firepower? It's the one thing where people will look from the outside and, like you said earlier, see that there is no superstar. Are you happy with what you've got? I think on a good day, we have the firepower to beat the best of the best, but doing it consistently is a problem. That's what we are working on, to find consistency in the individuals so that everyone feels comfortable, and also to get more experience in their new positions, to get all these teamplay things. We are a new team and although some people have played together, it's a mix of ENCE and Vitality. The only way you get to know each other is by playing official games. Sometimes we have lost games because we don't turn up individually, the way CS2 is right now you need to be consistent and make the least amount of mistakes because it's not that many rounds anymore, and with the economy and everything, you need to be really sharp from the beginning. Sometimes that's been our weakness, we start playing proper CS in the elimination matches, where the experience kicks in because it's all or nothing. That's something we are trying to work on, to be ready from game one. Sometimes the individual firepower is a little bit too inconsistent, but we are getting in the right direction. We are also now winning games when we don't feel like we are popping off individually, and I think that is a good sign.",25-8-2024 18:13,1724602380000
FaZe and Falcons cruise to BLAST Fall Final,https://www.hltv.org/news/39703/faze-and-falcons-cruise-to-blast-fall-final,"The eight teams set to face off in the Royal Arena in September have been decided. The BLAST Premier Fall Showdown has concluded, with FaZe and Falcons bagging the two remaining spots in the Fall Final over their respective opponents of OG and Virtus.pro. The team list for the competition taking place in Copenhagen from September 25-29 is now complete, and it looks as follows: FaZe have faced a number of shortcomings in recent months, failing to score many deep runs while also falling to sides like SAW and Ninjas in Pyjamas. Although the international side dropped a map to paiN earlier in the Showdown, FaZe recovered with a series win versus the Brazilians and carried that momentum into a straightforward victory over OG to move to the Fall Final. Likewise, Falcons are also a side that has struggled to attain notable results in recent memory, with a runner-up finish at ESL Challenger Jönköping being their most impressive showing in the last few months. After bagging an opening win over M80, Falcons had to contend with two of the highest-ranked sides in attendance, Complexity and Virtus.pro, but Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's men came out on top to secure Danny ""zonic"" Sørensen a place in the Royal Arena for the first time since 2019. FaZe's face-off versus OG kicked off the final day of play in the Showdown, with FaZe setting the pace early with a dominant 9-3 half on their opponent's pick of Dust2. OG pieced together some rounds after having a chance on the offense, but it was only a matter of time before FaZe stole away the map 13-8. OG were far more competitive to start on Ancient, managing to stay toe-to-toe with Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's men to secure a 6-6 halftime scoreline. Unfortunately for OG, their T-side was not nearly as fruitful, garnering only two rounds before FaZe sent them packing from the Showdown with another 13-8 win Falcons's series against Virtus.pro proved to be a similarly one-sided affair, as the international side hit the ground running on their pick of Vertigo, snagging ten rounds to Virtus.pro's meager two. Dzhami ""Jame"" Ali and co. were not dissuaded even despite the dreary first half, eventually crawling to double-digits right after Falcons claimed match point. In the end, a 1v4 clutch from Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García would put the nail in the coffin on Vertigo, locking it down for Falcons 13-10. Virtus.pro's pick of Mirage saw Falcons secure another blowout half, going 9-3 on the CT-side. This time around, Virtus.pro were unable to make the map competitive in the second half, faltering 6-13 after briefly extending their lifespan with a pistol win.",25-8-2024 22:46,1724618760000
paiN through to BB Dacha playoffs; BetBoom eliminated,https://www.hltv.org/news/39700/pain-through-to-bb-dacha-playoffs-betboom-eliminated,"The Brazilian outfit is the first team to make it out of the Play-In stage in Belgrade. paiN are through to the main stage of BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 after beating 9z 2-0 in Group A's upper bracket final. Meanwhile, BetBoom have been sent packing after a 0-2 loss to Falcons in the lower bracket. paiN join MOUZ, Spirit, Virtus.pro and HEROIC in the tournament's double-elimination playoff stage, which is slated to begin on August 28. Before that, however, they must play the group final on Tuesday, with $10,000 on the line. paiN and 9z had met each other just two weeks earlier to the day, in the group stage of IEM Cologne. Back then, the Argentine team had taken a map off paiN, exacting revenge for the loss in the group stage of the FiReLEAGUE 2024 Global Finals at the end of the season. This time around, Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt's troops required only two maps to move past their South American rivals. They ran out 13-9 winners on 9z's map pick of Nuke before coming back from 7-1 down on Inferno to win the map 13-10. In the group's lower bracket final, BetBoom were no match for Falcons, who produced an improved performance after yesterday's fade-away against 9z. This means that, for the second time in a row, BetBoom exit the company's own tournament without a single win to their name. In April, the team finished bottom of their group following losses to MOUZ and Falcons. Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García topped the scoreboard for Falcons on both maps while only rarely using the AWP - providing much-needed versatility to a team that has struggled for firepower all year long. Falcons are set for a rematch against 9z on Monday, with the team also taking part in the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown and IEM Rio.",25-8-2024 16:52,1724597520000
PARIVISION disqualified from Europe RMR over banned coach involvement*,https://www.hltv.org/news/39697/parivision-disqualified-from-europe-rmr-over-banned-coach-involvement,"Multiple staff members and a coach permanently banned from Valve-sponsored events were present in the room during at least one of PARIVISION's games in the EU RMR closed qualifier. 17:15  Update: PARIVISION rifler Robert ""Patsi"" Isyanov has since commented on his team's disqualification, describing it as ""the most ridiculous and sad situation in a career (if not in life)."" Perfect World, the organizers of the Shanghai Major, have announced that PARIVISION have been disqualified from the Europe RMRs due to having a Valve-banned individual present during their closed qualifier campaign. With PARIVISION's disqualification, the final spot in the Europe RMRs will be decided via a three-team single-elimination bracket. BLEED, Monte, and KOI will fight for the final RMR berth on offer as the three squads finished Closed Qualifier A with a 2-3 record, with BLEED receiving a bye into the final decider match due to having the highest Bucholz score of the trio. PARIVISION found itself in the crosshairs after a video of their post-match celebrations was posted on social media following their win against GamerLegion in the 2-1 qualification match. In the now-deleted footage, the team was surrounded by multiple staff members, including their coach, Ivan ""F_1N"" Kochugov. Not only is it against Valve's Major rules to have team staff present in the room for online matches in the Major cycle, but F_1N is also banned from participating in Valve Majors entirely. Despite that, sources told HLTV that F_1N was submitted as PARIVISION's coach as part of their official lineup, which indicates an oversight on Perfect World's part. Valve's Major rulebook, section Stage Integrity, sub-section Team staff restrictions says: ""In the case of any matches where event admins are not physically present (e.g. online matches), no team staff, including the coach, may be physically or virtually present or communicate with the players at any time during the match."" F_1N was one of over 30 coaches suspended in 2020 for using the infamous coach bug, which could give an unfair information advantage to the user. The 40-year-old was found to have used it in six official matches for 34 rounds, enough to earn a permanent ban from Valve, while the Esports Integrity Commission (ESIC) barred him from their member events for nearly nine months. ""It should be noted that Valve bans are by default the highest priority eligibility-related ruleset in any official event,"" reads Perfect World's statement. ""When these bans are well-known and established beforehand, as was the case here, it is expected that all teams should follow these eligibility rules prior to any further participation in an official event.""",25-8-2024 16:07,1724594820000
"biguzera: ""My feeling is I'm the team's father""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39701/biguzera-my-feeling-is-im-the-teams-father,"paiN's captain has his sights set on reaching the final in Belgrade. After falling just short of qualifying for playoffs at IEM Cologne, paiN have returned to competition with haste, competing in BetBoom Dacha Season 2 in Belgrade, Serbia. So far, the Brazilian side have found success in this outing, bagging wins over BetBoom and domestic rivals 9z to secure a place in the top eight of the event alongside names like MOUZ and Spirit. Not long after his team's victory over 9z, paiN captain Rodrigo ""biguzera"" Bittencourt shared his thoughts with HLTV regarding the matchup versus the South American side, paiN's aims for the event, and what the team is working to improve on in order to be able to contend with top teams. Congratulations on a 2-0 victory, but it was a pretty tough game. Yeah, it always is against 9z. They play so well all the time, and against them we never know how it will be, we just know it's gonna be difficult. You have played them a fair bit recently, obviously you played them in Cologne, does that make it harder? Yeah, of course when we play a lot against someone we know about each other. The tournament so far has been good, you have two wins. Are these the type of tournaments you look at and think paiN can go really deep, maybe make a final? Because there's a few top teams here, but not all the best teams in the world. Yeah of course. I think this kind of tournament we have a big chance to go far, to go deep, maybe a final or win the tournament. In general, paiN are on the verge of taking the next step and getting into that top echelon of teams. What do you think you need to do to get there, to take that next step to improve? Maybe I could say the usual words, 'play more in Europe,' but I don't think it's just this. We need to improve and be more calm sometimes, play situations better on the server. Everyone is good and has insane aim, these kinds of things, but sometimes we make some mistakes that the top 10 teams usually don't make. So we have to improve little things, but a lot of little things. It's like a puzzle, lots of little pieces. You have a team that doesn't necessarily have the most experience. What's it like for you leading a team with a couple of teenagers? For example there's snow who's barely played top CS. My feeling is always like I'm the father of the team, the daddy, and these kind of things. I'm always saying in my opinion what is wrong and right, and they always listen to me, so it's good. I'm very happy to be in a team like that, maybe I'm good with that role, so I like it. Throughout your career you've always been one of the best players on the teams you've played on. It's still the case now, for example in your last match you were the top player on the server, but it feels like you've got a lot of skill around you now. Does it feel like that, maybe there's a bit less pressure on you to frag every single game? Yeah for sure. To be on a team where everyone can shine all the time is good, because the pressure for me is just IGLing, not in the fragging. So for me it's a good thing.",25-8-2024 19:39,1724607540000
Live updates from Shanghai Major RMR qualifiers,https://www.hltv.org/news/39671/live-updates-from-shanghai-major-rmr-qualifiers,"As the second day of the Oceania closed qualifier began, Vantage forfeited their lower bracket match against Mindfreak after being unable to field their full lineup. This has resulted in the team's elimination from the tournament. The Art of War and Arcade are playing in the lower bracket now, and soon Rooster will play TALON for a place in the grand final: Teams like Gods Reign, True Rippers, and Hansel ""BnTeT"" Ferdinand's Alter Ego are in play for a single Asia RMR spot in the Rest of Asia closed qualifier, which is just going live with the opening round of the double-elimination bracket: Over in East Asia, Temuulen ""Zilkenberg"" Battulga's Chinggis Warriors and another Mongolian challenger ATOX are among the favorites: As a result of Take Flyte utilizing an improper substitution in their elimination match versus Legacy, a Perfect World representative has confirmed with HLTV that the North American side has been disqualified from the RMR closed qualifier. The ruling amounts to very little practically, as Take Flyte fell to Legacy 1-2 prior to Perfect World's decision, eliminating them from the competition entirely. The representative clarified that Take Flyte's loss will be counted as a forfeit. Fluxo have beaten inSanitY in the 1-1 pool of the South America RMR closed qualifier to avoid an early elimination. Andrei ""arT"" Piovezan's side had their backs up against the wall after getting upset, alongside RED Canids and ODDIK, in their opening match, but have now earned a chance at qualifying for the RMR after securing wins over Dusty Roots and inSanitY. The match against the latter team saw Fluxo nearly fumble enormous 11-1 and 12-3 leads on Inferno, scraping the win in round 24, before closing the series out on Mirage after nearly letting another 12-5 lead slip. Nouns have locked in an Americas RMR berth after reverse-sweeping NRG in the 2-0 pool. Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella's side recovered from a 3-7 deficit on their pick of Anubis and won the map to start the series on good footing, but were obliterated on Ancient 13-6 and unable to overcome a formidable 1.80-rated and 27-14 K-D performance from Jeorge ""Jeorge""  Endicott on the Mirage decider as Nouns closed out the series. Wildcard have locked in a spot at the Americas RMR in Shanghai after beating BOSS 2-0 in the first advancement match of the NA closed qualifier. The team around Peter ""stanislaw"" Jarguz has looked fearsome since adding Swedish duo Tim ""susp"" Ångström and Love ""phzy"" Smidebrant in July, and had little difficulty carving a path through the qualifier with one-sided wins over Mythic and E-Xolos LAZER before their win over BOSS. The second day of the NA RMR closed qualifier has begun with the two qualification games. Wildcard are playing against BOSS for an RMR spot, while Nick ""nitr0"" Cannella's NRG will meet Nouns. Later in the day, four best-of-three elimination matches are set to take place. 2-0 (qualification games) 1-1 (elimination games) BESTIA and Case have secured the first two Americas RMR spots avaliable after their respective wins over KRÜ and W7M in the 2-0 pool. The tournament has now moved to the 1-1 pool of matches, where the losers are set to be eliminated. The remaining teams are set to clash for the two remaining RMR spots: Six best-of-threes today in South America, with the winners of Case-W7M and KRÜ-BESTIA booking tickets to Shanghai. The losers of those 2-0 matches will then join the winners from the 1-1 games to form a brutal bracket where just two more slots will be decided from six 2-1 matches. 2-0 (qualification games) 1-1 record (elimination games) Steel Helmet, who made it to IEM Chengdu earlier in the year, are out of the Asian RMR closed qualifier in the first round after losses to TYLOO and Bromo. A disappointing outcome for veterans Hui ""DD"" Wu and Ke ""captainMo"" Liu. SHPL have also been knocked out of contention. The two favorites expected to fight for the single Asia RMR spot in Oceania's closed qualifier have so far delivered on their promise. Aaron ""AZR"" Ward's TALON and Rooster have reached the upper bracket final after cruising through the first two rounds. They will play a best-of-one against one another on Wednesday for a place in the grand final, where the team qualified for the Asia RMR will be decided on Thursday. Meanwhile, the first two elimination matches are about to go down in the land Down Under: The two highest-ranked teams in the Chinese closed qualifier have reached the upper final: TYLOO stomped Steel Helmet and Teamwork on the way, while Rare Atom went the distance against CatEvil. The first two elimination matches in the lower bracket are still due to be played before the first day of the qualifier draws to a close: One spot at the Asia RMR will be decided in each of the Chinese and Oceania closed qualifiers over the next three days. The competitions have just kicked off with names such as TYLOO and Rare Atom in play in China and Rooster and TALON in Oceania: The first two rounds of play concluded in the NA RMR closed qualifier with results going largely as expected, with the largest outlier being BOSS beating Legacy in the 1-0 pool to cast the Brazilian team down to the 1-1 elimination round. NRG, Nouns, and Wildcard join BOSS in the 2-0 advancement pool while LAG, Limitless, Phoenix, and Homyno had their runs ended early. The standings after day one can be found below: 2-0 advancement pool 1-1 elimination pool RED Canids have kept their Shanghai Major hopes alive after scraping together a reverse-sweep victory over Intense, losing Dust2 11-13 before edging out 13-11 and 13-10 wins on Mirage and Nuke. Fluxo and ODDIK, two other favorites who suffered early trips to the elimination round, bounced back with more confident wins over Dusty Roots and Vikings KR, respectively. Standings after day one: The second round of games in the North America RMR closed qualifier is about to get underway, with teams in the 1-0 pool facing off in best-of-ones before the four, best-of-three elimination matches in the 0-1 pool closes out the day. Outside of a close shave for NRG against Akimbo, the opening round of the NA RMR closed qualifier has gone as expected with all the favorites coming out on top. Notably, BOSS received a forfeit win after a member of Take Flyte got stuck in traffic and couldn't make it home in time for the start of his team's match. Favorites may have avoided each other in the second round of the South America RMR closed qualifier, but it still hasn't been smooth sailing for RED Canids. The team around Marcelo ""coldzera"" David and Henrique ""HEN1"" Teles dropped their opening best-of-one to Case, 11-13, and are now 0-1 down in their elimination best-of-three against Intense after another 11-13 loss. The same is the case for ODDIK, who lost their opening game in overtime and are now 0-1 down to Vikings KR. Andrei ""arT"" Piovezan's Fluxo, who also suffered an upset loss in their opening round, are faring better in their series against Dusty Roots in their own elimination match, while W7M, BESTIA, Case, and Max ""bayKo"" Bayko went 2-0 for the day and need to win just one best-of-three to make the RMR. The round-two matchups have been announced, and the favorites are set to avoid each other. The 0-1 pool is played in a best-of-three format, as teams get eliminated after two losses, while 1-0 games remain best-of-one. The full schedule is as follows: After some classic NA drama, the game has now gotten underway after a small 35-minute delay. Ryan ""freakazoid"" Abadir was nowhere to be found before Mythic's opening match against Wildcard. None of his teammates were able to reach the 31-year-old, and it looked like Mythic will need to forfeit the match. With just minutes to spare, Austin ""Cooper"" Abadir has now reached his brother, and the match might be happening after all. ODDIK, Fluxo, and RED Canids, the three highest-ranked squads at the closed qualifier, have all found themselves in the 0-1 bracket after opening losses. With just four RMR spots up for grabs, the trio is up against it early on. The second round will be drawn imminently and is set to begin at 21:00 . Two matches, two upsets at the Americas RMR closed qualifier, and the second and third highest-ranked squads find themselves in the 0-1 pool. Fluxo were bested by KRÜ in the opening match of the tournament, while Henrique ""HEN1"" Teles' RED Canids fell to Case in an 11-13 loss. The Americas closed qualifiers are kicking off today, starting with the South American side of things. The likes of Fluxo, Marcelo ""coldzera"" David's RED Canids, BESTIA and Sharks are in play among 16 teams who are fighting for just four spots at the Americas RMR. The first two rounds of the Swiss format will be played today, and the first-round matchups can be found below: A total of 40 teams from all over Asia, Oceania and Africa are now locked in to fight it out in five sub-regional closed qualifiers over the next four days. Only five of them will get to advance on the road to the Perfect World Shanghai Major and play in the Asia RMR in Shanghai at the beginning of November. Full story: After six teams were found via the open qualifier, the Rest of Asia closed qualifier team list has been finalized. These eight teams will play for one Asia RMR spot from August 28-30: It's a split down the middle between East Russian and Mongolian teams, who will fight it out for a single Asia RMR spot from August 28-30: Hansel ""BnTeT"" Ferdinand's Alter Ego are one of three teams to have advanced to the Rest of Asia closed qualifier after traversing the open qualifier without too much trouble. They're now playing for seeding in the closed qualifier, and they'll play for one Asia RMR spot there from August 28. Forward and Dewa United are also through so far, along with the invited Gods Reign and True Rippers, and three more spots will be decided over the course of the next few hours. IHC, -72c, THE and NomadS locked in four out of the five East Asia closed qualifier spots on offer in the open qualifier, joining Chinggis Warriors, ATOX and GR in the next stage. One more closed qualifier spot is up for grabs in the fifth-place decider bracket: The Rest of Asia region reached the quarter-final stage yesterday, most notably featuring Alter Ego, a team that boasts some well-known names: former TYLOO duo Hansel ""BnTeT"" Ferdinand and WingHei ""Freeman"" Cheung and ex-MVP PK member Hyun-Pyo ""XigN"" Lee. Six spots are up for grabs for the remaining eight teams in play today: The last stage of the final two open qualifiers for the Asia RMR are getting underway in the East and Rest of Asia regions. Five spots are on offer in East Asia, where NomadS already got a spot after Glamour had to forfeit the match due to not being able to field a full roster. The other three quarter-finals are live: The matches which will decide the replacement for the disqualified PARIVISION will be played on Tuesday, with KOI and Monte facing off first before the winner meets the highest-seeded BLEED: The East Asian qualifier has also reached the end of day one, with most of the favorites reaching the qualification matches. The exception are The Huns, who faltered in the first round in a 4-13 loss against horjoon. Five out of the remaining eight teams are set to secure East Asia RMR closed qualifier spots tomorrow. Two of the biggest names in the Rest of Asia qualifier have reached the quarter-final stage. NKT breezed through the competition to set up a qualification clash against Dewa United, while Alter Ego will face ONi for a closed qualifier spot tomorrow. BORING PLAYER have forfeited their qualification series against XNL due to a medical emergency affecting one of their players, with the team also unable to play in the fifth-place decider bracket as a result. This means XNL booked their spot in the closed qualifier, and that Steel Helmet get a bye to the lower-bracket qualification match, while kz5 and red demon will clash on the other side of the bracket. 29 teams have signed up to the Rest of Asia qualifier with the biggest names in the tournament being NKT and Forward, while Hyun-Pyo ""XigN"" Lee and Jane ""aidKiT"" Apostoloski have joined forces in Alter Ego. You can find the Rest of Asia bracket here. Over in East Asia, IHC and The Huns were the biggest favorites coming into the event, but the latter have already suffered elimination at the hands of horjoon. Other notable names include -72c, Clutch, and ARAVT. You can find the East Asia bracket here. The Chinese open qualifier is reaching the final stages, and the biggest name still in play, Steel Helmet, are up against the ropes after losing their quarter-final matchup against Bromo. They are still within a shot, as there are five closed qualifier spots on offer in China, but they will need to win the fifth-place decider bracket to advance. You can follow the bracket on HLTV. Today was a short day when it comes to HLTV's coverage of the road to the Shanghai Major RMRs. After the Oceania open qualifier found four teams advancing to the closed stage, only the massive Chinese open qualifier is still going on today. That will only be featured on HLTV from the quarter-finals, expected to be played tomorrow. We'll be back with that along with the other two Asia RMR open qualifiers due to take place tomorrow, in East Asia and Rest of Asia. After TALON, The Art of War, Vantage and Arcade came out on top in the open qualifier's quarter-finals, the Oceania closed qualifier teams are determined. These eight teams will fight for a single spot at the Asia RMR: The quarter-finals of the Oceania open qualifier have gone live with TALON fighting for one of four spots in the closed qualifier. Nemiga secured the final spot in the European RMRs after defeating Insilio in a three-map series. They join Rebels, Sashi, GamerLegion, TSM and B8 in making it out of the 2-2 pool. GamerLegion have secured a spot in the Europe RMRs after defeating BLEED 2-0 in the final Swiss round. Erik ""ztr"" Gustafsson's troops won both games in overtime, coming back from 12-3 down on Mirage to book a spot in Shanghai. It's a devastating blow for BLEED, who will once again miss a Major. TSM have locked up a place at the Europe RMRs after beating KOI in a 2-2 pool match. It's a heavy blow for the Iberian team, who reached the Copenhagen Major in February. KOI began their closed qualifier run by winning their best-of-one games but then struggled in the best-of-three series. Permitta's players will be kicking themselves after wasting three chances to qualify for the Europe RMRs. They won their opening two games but couldn't overcome the final hurdle as they lost three series against higher-ranked opponents, including fellow Polish side Rebels. OG, are out of the running for a spot at the Shanghai Major after losing to Sashi 0-2 in the final round of Closed Qualifier B. It's the second Major in a row that OG will miss. In the Copenhagen Major cycle, the team at least reached the RMRs before going 1-3 in Bucharest. OG got off on the wrong foot in their closed qualifier elimination series against Sashi as they were defeated 13-6 on Nuke, the Danish team's map pick. Philip ""Lucky"" Ewald was the star of the show as he put in a 2.24 rating, with only two of his 27 frags coming with the AWP. Next up is OG's map pick, Ancient. The 2-2 match-ups are: Group A Group B Two more teams have secured their places at the Europe RMRs with wins in the 2-1 pool of the closed qualifier, and there has been no shortage of surprises. Passion UA survived OG's comeback from down 2-10 on map two to win the series in three, and PARIVISION beat GamerLegion in another three-map series. OG and GamerLegion have one last chance to qualify in round five, played later today. With a 2-1 victory over BLEED, ECLOT are through to the Europe RMRs and become the second Czech core to qualify after SINNERS locked down their spot yesterday. It's last-chance saloon now for Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović's BLEED, who will play in the do-or-die round five next in an hour's time or so. The Oceania open qualifier reached the quarter-finals earlier today. Among teams who made it are Aaron ""AZR"" Ward's TALON, who will be going up against SemperFi for one of the four closed qualifier spots on offer tomorrow: The next series of matches in the European closed qualifiers are getting underway. Playing in the 2-1 pool and fighting for a place at the RMRs are the likes of OG, BIG and GamerLegion. The pressure is on, as losers will have to play another series back-to-back in the last chance round five. With a loss to Rebels in the 1-2 pool, Johnny Speeds have been eliminated from the tournament. The Swedish side played the tournament with Sebastian ""dex"" Samuelsson after Hugo ""chawzyyy"" Günther was sidelined by personal issues, and entered the elimination zone early after losses to Cloud9 and ARCRED in the first two rounds. In the end, they were just one round away from making it to the 2-2 deciders but failed to convert a 12-8 lead on the final map against Rebels. After the 13-1 start on Ancient Monte couldn't close it out on their map pick, Anubis, which went the distance. But ultimately, it went the way of the Polish-majority squad on Mirage, as they turned a 7-5 lead on the CT side into a 13-7 victory in the decider. The Chinese open qualifier has begun today with a staggering 8,600 teams in attendance — a huge increase in interest ahead of China's home Major compared to the PGL Copenhagen qualifier, which had around 3,100 teams. The bracket is not publicly available outside of Perfect World's Chinese platform, but once it reaches the late stages in the next two days it will be featured on HLTV. The first matches of the day are over. B8 secured their survival in the closed qualifier over one of the weaker teams in the lineup, Rhyno, with a 2-0 victory, while TSM also made it past BC.Game in two maps. Qiang was also eliminated in two maps by Insilio, while the three other first round matches have gone to a third map. The Polish AWPer dominated ENCE in Monte's 13-1 victory on Ancient. Monte now head to their map pick, Anubis, up 1-0 in the series. Six teams with 1-2 records in the Europe RMR face off for survival. Most notably, Monte and ENCE will meet in a clash that will see one team go home and the other advance to the 2-2 pool. Johnny Speeds, who have been impressing locally in Sweden and online but went 0-2 while playing with a stand-in, are also fighting to make it to the round of decider matches after a victory over Zero Tenacity. They face Rebels. Group A Group B Insilio and Johnny Speeds have tallied wins in the 0-2 pool of RMR Qualifier B, besting AMKAL and Zero Tenacity, respectively, to stay alive heading into the final day of play. The Swedish team around William ""draken"" Sundin were blown out by Cloud9 and ARCRED in their opening best-of-ones and didn't look particularly convincing against Zero Tenacity, laboring to an overtime win on Mirage and 13-11 win on the Inferno decider largely thanks to 1.56 and 1.83-rated maps from Jonatan ""bobeksde"" Persson. AMKAL survived a messy affair against Ninjas in Pyjamas in BLAST Fall Showdown on Wednesday after edging out victory on Vertigo, and started their series against Insilio with another overtime win on the same map. That quickly gave way to blowouts on Nuke and Mirage, however, as Insilio romped to a reverse-sweep victory to advance to the 2-0 pool. ENCE hasn't had a pretty start to the RMR qualifier, falling to the 0-2 pool after losses to KOI and UNiTY, but early elimination has been avoided for now after Lukas ""gla1ve"" Rossander's side moved past Enterprise in a two-map series. TSM's Danish roster were in the same boat with one-sided defeats to BLEED and GamerLegion stinging their confidence, but a comfortable 2-0 over 1WIN offers some respite despite the team having their backs against the wall. It wasn't pretty, but Cloud9 did just enough to squeak past 9 Pandas and secure their RMR berth. A 1-13 spanking on Anubis will do little for Cloud9's confidence overall, particularly considering the fact they were pushed all the way on the other maps, but they got the job done. Sergey ""Ax1Le"" Rykhtorov's resurgent form is a big plus for Cloud9, the No. 4 player in the world in 2022 was a significant factor in his team managing to clinch the qualification series. Sangal and SAW have joined SINNERS in securing RMR qualification. Sangal, who have been in excellent form in recent months, had to battle through tough maps against BC.Game and BLEED, but ultimately Samet ""jottAAA"" Köklü's strong showings helped get them over the line. SAW followed up their immense IEM Cologne run with a fairly comfortable stroll through the closed qualifier, the usual suspects of João ""story"" Vieira, Michel ""ewjerkz"" Pinto and Rafael ""arrozdoce"" Wing doing much of the heavy lifting. SINNERS have qualified for the Shanghai Major Europe RMR, and it was in no small part due to the superlative performances of Tomáš ""oskar"" Šťastný. The AWPer rolled back the years to harken back to his prime form to guide SINNERS through the closed qualifier with minimal fuss. We're really getting to the business end of things now in the Europe RMR qualifiers, with a raft of qualification best-of-threes getting underway. Plenty of the big-name teams are fighting in this round of matches: Both Sashi and Monte are at risk of having their Major dreams ended early. Sashi, the third highest-ranked team in their qualifier, find themselves in the 1-2 pool after a hard-fought loss against Nemiga. The Danes had already dropped a game to Qiang earlier in the qualifier. Monte meanwhile were comfortably bested by ECLOT, a team over 20 places below them in the world ranking, having already lost to KOI yesterday. We're back for more Perfect World Shanghai Major qualification action, and already there are teams who will have their hearts broken and teams who will get to the next step chasing their dreams. Aleksandar ""kassad"" Trifunović's BLEED are one step from the RMR, alongside the likes of Cloud9 and SAW, whilst surprisingly Lukas ""gla1ve"" Rossander's ENCE are already fighting for their lives in an elimination match, as are the Danes of TSM. Qualification matches 1-1 matches Elimination matches The first day of the qualifiers for the RMR events has come to an end. Here is all that you need to know: Unlucky Much? join DRILLAS and POGGERZ in securing a spot in the Middle East closed qualifier for the Asian RMR via the Levant and North Africa open qualifiers. The Algerian team beat Lebanon in a close two-map series. With the first two rounds now behind us, here are the match-ups for the third round, which will already include advancement (Bo3) and elimination (Bo3) matches: Group A Group B After being stunned by Passion UA in the first round of the EU RMR Closed Qualifier B, BIG picked up their first win as they brushed aside Insilio on Ancient. The German outfit will now enter the 1-1 pool, which also includes teams like Nemiga, OG and Rebels. SAW, the highest-ranked team in the EU RMR closed qualifiers, are one victory away from the LAN event after thrashing Qiang 13-4  on Nuke. Meanwhile, 9 Pandas made light work of Rebels, beating the Polish team 13-5 on Nuke. The two teams join Cloud9 and Permitta in the 2-0 pool. The qualifying matches will be played tomorrow at 13:00 . 1WIN, who made headlines last month after signing Abay ""HObbit"" Khassenov from Cloud9, are facing elimination in Closed Qualifier A after losing to Sangal and ECLOT. The PGL Major Krakow champion put in a game-high 1.49 rating but it was not enough as his team lost 13-11 on Mirage. Frederik ""acoR"" Gyldstrand was helpless to prevent a defeat against his former team as TSM were thrashed 13-3 by GamerLegion in the 0-1 pool of the EU RMR Closed Qualifier A. This means that Valdemar ""valde"" Bjørn Vangså's troops are now one loss away from elimination. In the first round, TSM lost to BLEED 13-8. DRILLAS, the mix team that is supported by streamer ohnePixel, has secured a spot in the Middle East closed qualifier for the Asian RMR after beating Unlucky Much? 2-0 in the semi-finals of the Levant and North Africa open qualifier. Later today, DRILLAS will play a best-of-one game against the winner of the other semi-final, for seeding purposes. Passion UA were on their way to tallying another upset after beating BIG in the first round. Down 5-7 after their CT side on Mirage, they won five on the trot to make it 10-7, but everything changed when they lost to an eco and the Ukrainians deflated as Cloud9 won it out, 10-13. The second round of the European closed qualifier is underway with four 1-0 matches, two in each group. The second round of matches in the EU RMR Closed Qualifier is set, they are: The Levant and North Africa open qualifier has reached the final round, whose winners will advance to the MIddle East closed qualifier. ohnePixel's DRILLAS team and the former Twisted Minds core now competing as POGGERZ are both in play, and you can follow the action on HLTV: Meanwhile, Richard ""shox"" Papillon's mix-team was eliminated in the second round by Lebanon. Group A Group B 9 Pandas were embroiled in a dramatic situation with Aurora, as a trade which would see Evgeny ""r3salt"" Frolov join the side while Timur ""clax"" Sabirov went the other way was initially called off. Finally, the trade went through moments before 9 Pandas' opening match, and r3salt put in a fine performance (1.40 rating, 17-9, 99.5 ADR) in his debut victory after officially becoming a member of the team against Insilio (he had previously played an ESL Challenger League match with the team before his transfer was made official). Guy ""anarkez"" Trachtman was joint-best in BC.Game's opener alongside Aleksandar ""CacaNito"" Kjulukoski in their first victory in Group A of the EU RMR's closed qualifier. The Israeli AWPer handed his former team, ECLOT, their first defeat in the tournament while tallying a 1.22 rating. The match, played on Mirage, was close and decided in extra rounds, 16-19. It didn't take long for SINNERS to dismantle B8 on Nuke. The two teams last played each other only a few days ago, on August 12, in ESL Challenger League, with the Czech squad also clearing their Ukrainian foes, that time by 2-0. Tomáš ""oskar"" Šťastný was the star of the show as he led the way on the T side with 13 kills and capped a fantastic game after the switch. SINNERS took their 9-3 lead and ran to victory with a clean 4-0 on the defense. The South African open qualifier is the last of the three leading up to the Middle East closed qualifier to kick off, and it most notably features Bravado, who recently made a move to Serbia in the second running of 'Project Destiny'. They are playing among 12 other teams for three closed qualifier spots, and the bracket can be found here on Challenger Mode.

The day two schedule is as follows: The IEM Rio Europe closed qualifier is underway with eight teams battling through a best-of-three, double-elimination bracket for two spots at the Brazilian event. The opening round of games has ended with two notable upsets, seeing fnatic and HEROIC sent careening down to the lower bracket following losses to 3DMAX and Cloud9, respectively. Damjan ""kyxsan"" Stoilkovski's side is in a particularly torrid run of form, getting eliminated early from BLAST Fall Showdown in floundering fashion, and now needs to win four best-of-threes in a row if they want to make it to Rio — starting with a match against B8 at 19:30 . Rhyno have announced that they have brought in Filipe ""NOPEEJ"" Dias and David ""P3R3IIRA"" Pereira to replace Diogo ""DDias"" Dias and Tiago ""TMKj"" Martins.

BetBoom Dacha Belgrade S2 playoff bracket set,https://www.hltv.org/news/39720/betboom-dacha-belgrade-s2-playoff-bracket-set,"Spirit will look to shrug off their disastrous Cologne showing as they take on Falcons in their opening match. The bracket and opening matchups for the main stage of BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 have been revealed following the conclusion of the Play-in. FURIA, paiN, Falcons, and Eternal Fire advanced from the first stage to secure spots in the best-of-three, double-elimination bracket, with the two Brazilian teams securing the higher seeds from the Play-in after winning best-of-ones in their respective group finals. As a result, Falcons and Eternal Fire have been matched up against the champions of BetBoom Dacha and BetBoom Dacha Belgrade S1, Spirit and MOUZ, respectively, in the first round of games and on opposite sides of the bracket. Leonid ""chopper"" Vishnyakov's side arrives in Belgrade looking to shrug off a disastrous showing at IEM Cologne, where Spirit won a combined eight rounds in three out of four map losses. The Russian in-game leader told HLTV that he had the wrong expectations of the team at the event and touched on some issues that cropped up before Cologne, which he says the team has tried to solve ahead of Dacha. ""The most important thing for us at this event is to join the server and enjoy playing with each other,"" he said. Spirit were beaten by MOUZ in Belgrade the last time out, and Kamil ""siuhy"" Szkaradek's men have remained in excellent form since then while starting to take strides toward shaking off struggles in big arenas by beating G2 in the quarter-finals of IEM Cologne and taking the fight to Natus Vincere in a close 0-2 defeat. The two teams are heavy favorites in the double-elimination bracket, with the other opening-round games featuring teams looking to turn around lackluster starts to the season. Virtus.pro's identity struggles since adding Denis ""electroNic"" Sharipov continue to plague them, and their issues on the server were laid bare in a 0-2 loss to Falcons in BLAST Fall Showdown. The team comes into Belgrade hoping to bounce back against FURIA, but with Spirit or a rematch against Falcons next in the cards, a solution to their spiral will be needed post-haste. HEROIC, too, are in troubled waters. Although visa issues for Abdul ""degster"" Gasanov have hamstrung the Norwegian organization in some of its tournament appearances, the team's communication and team play has been a glaring issue, with Eetu ""sAw"" Saha admitting after HEROIC were eliminated from the Showdown that there are a lot of problems they need to fix. The main stage of BetBoom Dacha Belgrade Season 2 will kick off on Wednesday and run through until Sunday, September 1 when the champion of the double-elimination bracket is crowned.

"FalleN: ""9 Pandas said playing us and winning doesn't matter. I wanted to make sure it does""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39718/fallen-9-pandas-said-playing-us-and-winning-doesnt-matter-i-wanted-to-make-sure-it-does,"FalleN wanted to exact revenge against 9 Pandas, and he made sure to do exactly that. FURIA have been making steady forward progress since adding Felipe ""skullz"" Medeiros to their ranks in the player break, making the playoffs of Esports World Cup and the main event at IEM Cologne. They have continued that trend in Belgrade, recovering from an opening loss to 9 Pandas to secure first place in their group and progress from the Play-in. In the process they grabbed a revenge victory over 9 Pandas and a morale-boosting BO1 win over Eternal Fire. The 9 Pandas match came with some added spice, as Aleksandr ""shalfey"" Marenov had stated to HLTV that his team's result over FURIA was ""not a big win,"" before Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo then said in an interview with esports.gg that 9 Pandas were ""not that good."" Fresh from his team's two victories, FalleN saw down with HLTV to discuss FURIA's campaign in Belgrade so far, his revenge arc against 9 Pandas, and how far along FURIA are in their development with skullz among their number. If you cannot see the SoundCloud embed above, you can listen to the interview here. First off, congratulations, how does it feel to make the main event? It feels amazing. I think we progressed well after the first match, kept playing well, getting better and getting form. I'm glad that we won first place, it's a good result for us. How does it feel to get a win over Eternal Fire? It must be a confidence-booster, they were top-eight at the last Major. Yeah I like Eternal Fire a lot, we respect each very much and we do pracs against each other once in a while. It's a team that we like to play against, I think they play very well, very structured, and I like watching their games as well. It's always a pleasure to play them and I'm happy with the win, it's a big win for us. You had a couple of struggles on Dust2, twice today you got to 12 rounds and couldn't close it out. What was going on there? Ah sometimes it just doesn't go your way. I think we had a couple of chances to finish here and there, maybe I could have called a bit better to finish it up earlier. There's a few small things that could have gone differently, but overall I think the opponents were putting up a defense as well, they were able to contest us. In the end, it's not about who throws the first punch, it's about who can take more of them. You had a really good day today, particularly against 9 Pandas you were on fire, rolling back the years. Why do you think that was? I really wanted to win this game. I heard that they said playing against us and winning wasn't a big deal, like it doesn't matter. So I just wanted to make sure it does matter, because otherwise you go home. You were very aggressive I think particularly in that game, lots of opening picks on Dust2. Was it along the same lines, wanting to take control of the game? I felt like on the first Dust2 I played during the tournament I used the Long spawns too much on CT side, so it was pretty much a one-sided game for me. For some reason I always got the Long spawn. In this game I came with a different approach, and yeah I was winning the fights, we had some set plays in order for me to capitalize and get some openings, and the rest is just happening. I'm very happy with finding those kills and finding this impact for the team. You brought skullz in and it's a little bit of a different-look FURIA now. Where do you think you are in your journey, how far along are you from getting to top-form, prime FURIA? Honestly, I think we are not where we want to be at, but I think we are on the way, we have been progressing and having good results with skullz so far. So for us its all about getting more understanding of the game, getting more cohension, mainly on maps like Dust2 for example, where KSCERATO and yuurih didn't have many reps with the last iteration. For us it's all about improving every game, improving every tournament. For me personally, it's all about finding a way to play more games like I played today, and being able to mix the roles I have inside the team. I also have to IGL, I have to AWP, so I'm trying to find the balance where I can put more impact on the numbers frag-wise as well, without stopping the other stuff I do for the team as well. It's all about trying to find the combination.",27-8-2024 20:09,1724782140000
"BESTIA, Case secure Americas RMR spots",https://www.hltv.org/news/39722/bestia-case-secure-americas-rmr-spots,"Just two more RMR spots remain up for grabs in South America. The second day of the Perfect World Shanghai Major 2024 SA RMR closed qualifier began with BESTIA and Case securing spots at the Americas RMR following their respective wins against KRÜ and W7M. This means just two more spots remain up for grabs. BESTIA and Case will be joined by two teams from the 3-1 pool, with a fourth-place decider set to be played between the two 3-1 teams with the lower Bucholz scores for the final spot. BESTIA began their qualifying campaign with best-of-one victories over Vikings KR and Galorys to make the 2-0 match. There, they would face KRÜ, an organization founded and co-owned by ex-Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero. BESTIA found themselves down a map after a 5-13 loss on Dust2, but bounced back on Ancient (13-4) — where Luciano ""luchov"" Herrera put up a 2.46 rating — and Anubis (13-8) to make it to the Americas RMR in Shanghai. The second 2-0 match saw W7M meet Case, with the latter another organization owned by a famous footballer — Brazil's Casemiro. His team previously upset RED Canids and breezed past Solid, and their qualification was equally straightforward. A 13-1 win on Anubis was followed by a 13-9 triumph on Inferno, which proved more than enough for Case to book a trip to China.",27-8-2024 20:42,1724784120000
Eternal Fire qualify for IEM Rio,https://www.hltv.org/news/39723/eternal-fire-qualify-for-iem-rio,"The Turkish team locked in the first of two spots at Rio available through the Europe qualifier. Eternal Fire have secured a spot at IEM Rio after romping through the Europe closed qualifier, securing relatively comfortable 2-0 victories over B8, Cloud9, and Falcons to cruise through the upper bracket undefeated. Marco ""Snappi"" Pfeiffer's side have one more chance to book a ticket to Brazil in the consolidation final, where they await the winner of a lower bracket match between HEROIC and fnatic. Eternal Fire and Falcons took part in the qualifier while playing in Serbia at BetBoom Dacha Belgrade, and both succeeded in advancing from the Play-in stage of the LAN event while simultaneously fighting through the Rio qualifier's upper bracket. Eternal Fire were convincing in their qualifier run as they dismantled B8 and Cloud9 in one-sided series victories, whereas Falcons were tested by OG and 3DMAX in games that went the distance with a handful of close maps. The Turkish team didn't start their qualifying series with the same aplomb, going down 3-9 on their pick of Vertigo against a stalwart defense from Pavle ""Maden"" Bošković, Álvaro ""SunPayus"" García, and Snappi, but recovered spectacularly on the CT side. Ismailcan ""XANTARES"" Dörtkardeş, who ended the first half 1-12 and spoke of how tiring the recent days have been after the game, led the charge in the Turkish team's recovery effort as they pulled the map all the way back and edged out victory, 13-11. Clip: MAJ3R's 1v2 to close the series Falcons fell completely flat on their Anubis pick, a pistol round win on the CT side being all they had to their name for most of the first half before they added two to their tally before the side switch. Eternal Fire won the second pistol and quickly reached series point, 12-3, and although Falcons started to close the gap after an untimely disconnect for one of the Turks, Engin ""MAJ3R"" Küpeli put a halt to the effort with a 1vs2 clutch to close the game.

Wildcard and Nouns have locked in spots at the Perfect World Shanghai Major Americas RMR after going 3-0 through the NA closed qualifier's Swiss stage. The teams claimed victory over BOSS and NRG, respectively, in the first advancement matches, leaving just two spots up for grabs to teams who go through with a 3-1 record. A fourth-place decider will be played between the two 3-1 teams with the lowest Bucholz score for the final spot. The result leaves NRG in a particualrly precarious position with a match against Legacy likely in the cards, as long as the Brazilian team is not eliminated by Take Flyte. Gabriel ""NEKIZ"" Schenato's side was upset by BOSS in the second round of play and ended up in the elimination pool early, with BOSS going on to face Wildcard for a spot at the RMR. Matthew ""Cryptic"" Whitmore's side couldn't make it through on their first try, however, with Wildcard looking fearsome since adding Swedish duo Love ""phzy"" Smidebrant and Tim ""susp"" Ångström. The team eased past Mythic and E-Xolos LAZER in the best-of-one rounds before beating BOSS 2-0 in the advancement match, needing all 24 rounds on Nuke before running away with Dust2 after a slow start. Nouns didn't have an easy run to their RMR spot, going from beating FLUFFY AIMERS 13-6 to nearly losing to a comeback to Party Astronauts, eventually closing the game 16-13. They got off to a strong start on NRG's pick of Anubis, going up 7-3 on the T side, but lost the edge near the end of the first half and were run over once on the defense, 10-13. Nouns wasted little time in recovering from that, however, crushing NRG 13-6 on Ancient before a 1.80-rated performance from Jeorge ""Jeorge""  Endicott on the Mirage decider helped his team take things over the line.",28-8-2024 00:13,1724796780000

Wildcard and Nouns were the victors in the North American qualifier, booking their tickets to Shanghai after claiming 3-0 records in the Swiss bracket. In regards to eliminations, by far the most notable side to miss out on a shot of reaching the RMR was Party Astronauts, who were stamped out by a FLUFFY AIMERS lineup recently invigorated by the addition of Edgar ""MarKE"" Maldonado. The other three sides to bow out on day two in North America's qualifier were Mythic, Akimbo, and Take Flyte, the latter of whom received a post-elimination disqualification for improper use of a substitute during their elimination match against Legacy.
