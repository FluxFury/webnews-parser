After the series, , had nothing but praise for his team. ""The way we played today, the comms and the energy on the team were pretty nice,"" he said.,Looking ahead to Tuesday's match, , said that he expects his team to come out with the same intensity they showed against , and ,. A victory will see , step onto the LANXESS arena stage for the first time since 2016, when he helped , reach the semi-finals.,Why weird? I mean, it was a normal match. Sometimes you win with pretty good scores, sometimes you struggle in some of the halves. I'm pretty fine, obviously, with the score. I would say that today we played pretty nice CS. The only bad half, I would say, was CT Mirage. Maybe we focused too much on helping me on B instead of playing, like, maybe default. I'm not sure, I'm not going to leak everything. But I would say that the way we played today, the comms and the energy on the team were pretty nice.,I wouldn't say so. On Dust2, we also had a good score and we kept it cool the entire T side. So I would say it was the same. We just lost the pistol, then some close rounds, and it was just hard to come back.,I said, 'Ancient is a pretty good map for us. Just forget about Mirage, it doesn't matter now. We still have one map to win' I just wanted to reset, I wanted all the guys to chill before Ancient. I said, like, 'I think I have a good plan against them on the T side. Even if we win the knife, we take T side.' We started on the T side and it looked pretty good. Also, insane plays from Mario [malbsMd] and everyone else on the team. It was nice to see.,Yes, but I'm not going to reveal every secret of my thinking, of my knowledge of CS, but for sure there are. We're going to talk after the match. Individually, I can say that maybe I wanted too much to help the guys today. On Dust2, I feel that we all played really well. On the second and third map, I felt like I wanted too much but my guys were trading so I was okay with that. We showed solid CS today overall.,I think both teams are solid. We could see after the SAW game we had struggles and they beat us pretty convincingly in this BO3. I think if we just go with the same energy we had versus Spirit and Astralis, we can win it.,Obviously, I always love to play in front of a crowd. It's always fun, you know, to listen to the people shout and cheer for the teams. It would be nice. I would rather play in Katowice. You know, for the Polish crowd. But it would be nice to be back on a big stage.,The Polish captain praised his team's performance in the elimination series against Astralis."

It was our map pick, and we thought it was like a punish pick, but to be honest, we lost the pistol, and that's how it is. In the first couple of rounds, I didn't feel like we followed our game plan, and there was just a tense feeling while playing. If you want to play a good series, you need to be able to be calm and enjoy it, and I don't feel like anyone did. Yeah, we just got wrecked.,The one good thing to take away from this series is the comeback on Mirage. We had a really good game plan on Mirage, and we followed it there, and we believed that we could come back. We gained some momentum on the T side, and then we just kept rolling because we had a good read on how they would respond to different things. Really happy with the comeback on Mirage.,Sure, they were playing with full confidence. They are playing really well at the moment, you could also see it in the game against Spirit, they absolutely destroyed them as well. When they are pulling out knives, obviously, it's disrespectful, you know? I've been on teams before when we were destroying a team like that, and it's the easiest thing to do. It's just disrespect.,Yeah, I agree. On Ancient, midway through, there were a lot of frustrations. On the Ancient CT side, we were usually really good, but we couldn't play our game against them. Malbs was playing really well on Mid and denying our typical Mid control, so it was hard.,It's always hard coming back after a player break. You need to find the groove again, and I would say we have done that in some moments in some games. But I feel like after the break, we haven't really found our top game yet. And when you are losing rounds the way we are, then obviously some frustration comes out. So we just need to fix it.,This game against G2, and also the NAVI game, are obviously teams that we want to be able to compete with. They are top teams, title contenders, and we want to be there as well, and we haven't shown that we are there yet. I feel like before the player break, we showed it. So we just need to keep working to come to that level.,Right now, it's obviously tough, but we just need to look forward. Cologne is an important tournament, but the most important is obviously the Major. That's the goal for every team and the main goal for us. So now we have some decent time to be able to practice and look at what we need to fix. So we need to just get back on the drawing board, as you say.,Astralis have been eliminated from Cologne after one-sided losses to NAVI and G2."
