Short news: Week 33,https://www.hltv.org/news/39595/short-news-week-33," A small patch has just been released for CS2, with the most notable tweak being changes to ""tagging effects"" in order to ""reduce instances of players experiencing teleportation when taking damage."" Additionally, it seems that Valve have also introduced measures of some kind to track the utilization Snap Tap, although to what end this information is being collected remains to be seen. You can view the full patch notes of the update here. Wednesday saw the start of the first IEM Rio EU Open Qualifier, and several big names are already eliminated. Ninjas in Pyjamas are out after a loss to LEON, while ENCE were eliminated by 500. BC.Game, who are playing with Simon ""⁠KWERTZZ⁠"" Horák, are also out, as are GamerLegion, TSM, and Metizport. The first day of action is still underway, with the eliminated squads set to receive one more chance in the second open qualifier, set to start on August 18. You can take a look at the bracket here. Into the Breach have put out a Tweet saying that changes in their CS2 roster are imminent, confirming an earlier Tweet by Owen ""⁠smooya⁠"" Butterfield. The team built around the British AWPer had big expectations at the time of inception but is currently ranked at just No. 104 in the world rankings after a 50% win rate in the last three months. It is worth noting that the team utilized ex-PERA player Áron ""⁠Aaron⁠"" Homoki in lieu of Mohammad ""⁠BOROS⁠"" Malhas in their match versus ECLOT in YaLLa Compass Summer 2024 Contenders earlier today, where Into the Breach secured a 2-0 series victory. Christopher ""⁠dexter⁠"" Nong has put out a public appeal for analysts to work with FlyQuest after the team suffered poor results at IEM Cologne's Play-In, Esports World Cup, and IEM Dallas. ""I had health issues,"" Sergey ""⁠hally⁠"" Shavaev told the Spirit IEM Cologne vlog. ""We decided it was best for me to recover fully so I would not miss Cologne."" Plenty more tidbits in the team's vlog from their disastrous Cologne campaign. This is likely to ensure the ranking is sufficiently up-to-date to work as a meritocratic invite system, but it does create some issues in terms of visas in such a short timeline. ""I implore you, please rethink this decision,"" Complexity GM Graham ""messioso"" Pitt wrote on Twitter. ""Set the window between 16 and 12 weeks. 16 weeks allows TO's to host their events in great, global locations, where visas may be harder to plan for."" Danny ""⁠mahone⁠"" Hsieh and Leetify have released a video looking at the win-rate of starting T and CT, and common wisdom may be getting you in the wrong boat. Fluxo announced two changes. One is that Richard ""⁠chayJESUS⁠"" Seidy has been moved to the bench, while in Fluxo Demons it is Julia ""⁠julih⁠"" Gomes who has been removed from the starting five. Perfect World have opened up registrations for open qualifiers leading up to the Asia RMR closed qualifiers in various regions: - Rest of Asia- Levant and North Africa- Arabia- Oceania- East Asia- South Africa ESL released an hour-long podcast featuring Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen, Dan ""⁠apEX⁠"" Madesclaire and Aleksi ""⁠Aleksib⁠"" Virolainen from the IEM Cologne media day, in which the trio discusses the trials of in-game leadership. There are plenty of little tidbits and insight from each about their experiences being an IGL and their current and past teammates, and well worth a watch:"
Metizport sign L00m1; Plopski takes on the mantle of IGL,https://www.hltv.org/news/39613/metizport-sign-l00m1-plopski-takes-on-the-mantle-of-igl,"Jackinho will not renew his contract with the organization as he steps back from the game.  Metizport has announced the signing of 23-year-old Lucas ""⁠L00m1⁠"" Haukland to round out the team, which was depleted to four players after Jack ""⁠Jackinho⁠"" Ström Mattsson announced he was taking a step back from Counter-Strike. The organization has now shared that their former captain will not renew his contract, which is set to expire on August 31, and will therefore not return to the team. L00m1, who had been standing in for Metizport, and even helped them qualify for the BLAST Premier Fall Showdown over the likes of Johnny Speeds and TSM, will therefore take over the big green on a permanent basis. ""Even though he’s relatively new to the scene, his impressive talent with the AWP and fresh perspective brings a lot of potential to our roster,"" Metizport's coach Ahmed ""⁠abdi⁠"" Abdi said. ""I believe that his hunger to prove himself, combined with our support, will lead to great things. I am looking forward to watching him grow and make a significant impact in the matches ahead."" Jackinho's departure also left the in-game leadership up for grabs, and it's Nicolas ""⁠Plopski⁠"" Gonzalez Zamora who will take a step forward in his career by taking over the team's captaincy. ""Taking over the IGL role is a new challenge for me as a player and something I’ve never tried before, but it’s also very exciting to see where this will take me as a player and as a team,"" Plopski said. ""Luckily, I’ve had many great IGLs and players throughout my career from whom I’ve learned a lot. I will use that experience to help my team as much as I can, together with our coach, Abdi."" Metizport is now: Nicolas ""⁠Plopski⁠"" Gonzalez Zamora Anton ""⁠Sapec⁠"" Palmgren Linus ""⁠nilo⁠"" Bergman Adam ""⁠adamb⁠"" Ångström Lucas ""⁠L00m1⁠"" Haukland Ahmed ""⁠abdi⁠"" Abdi (coach)"
"NEO: ""Winning like this is a huge boost""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39618/neo-winning-like-this-is-a-huge-boost,"The Polish coach shared his thoughts on a ""rollercoaster"" of a series after his team made it to the playoffs.  FaZe locked up the final spot at the LANXESS Arena on Tuesday following a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Liquid in a high-octane series where they had to come back from 11-1 down on the decider map, Mirage, after letting two match points slip on Nuke. Speaking to HLTV after the match, FaZe coach Filip ""⁠NEO⁠"" Kubski admitted that he was ""really mad"" that his team didn't close out Nuke but said that he didn't lash out in frustration so as to not ruin the mood for the final map. Despite the hefty half-time deficit, he insisted everyone believed a comeback was possible. The victory puts FaZe on a collision course with SAW in the quarter-finals, with a semi-final clash with Vitality on the horizon. FaZe have shown in the past that they can shift into a higher gear when they get into playoff mode, and while NEO said that the competition in Cologne is strong, he stressed the impact of this victory on his team's morale. ""Winning like this is a huge boost."" NEO, a very crazy series. There was one point towards the end of Mirage where the camera was on you and you were just laughing. What is going through your head right now? It's really hard to say one thing. This game was full rollercoaster mode. Starting with Nuke, we should have won, there was a 5v3 situation that we lost. And I was actually really mad after losing Nuke because it should have been our map. But the mood was okay. It was all fine, the guys were laughing, so, like, I took a step back and didn't even say a thing. It got to Mirage and we all know how it started. It was another surprise start. One-eleven. That was a disaster of a half for us. Surprisingly, the mood was not terrible. The guys started laughing a little bit. I wasn't feeling funny at the time. But yeah, I had to accept it, I guess, and go with the flow. The funny thing was that everybody believed, you know? We feel that we have been playing really good CS. It was a small mistake on Nuke, or a huge one, actually. We won in the end, that's what matters. At half-time on Mirage, someone said, ""We only have 12 rounds to go,"" and everyone started laughing. What was the mindset heading into the first half? There was also the pistol, where broky started flipping them off and rain was laughing. Did the players really believe at the time that the comeback was possible? Or were you simply trying to get as many rounds as possible? Yeah, yeah. You always take it step by step, right? It's the first round, then the second round, then the third… It's incredible. The thing is that we all believed, I think, we could still win, even though we were down 11-1. I think the guys felt confident and also frustrated at some point even, that it had got to a score like this. So yeah, they kept winning, round by round, and Robin played an insane map. It worked out in the end. It was a much-needed performance from ropz, who has struggled recently. Here he had a key performance at a crucial moment. Yeah, for sure. He has been stepping up recently. He has had some good games this tournament. I think it's just adjustments that have to be made, and he's been doing a great job talking about stuff within our game plans and how to make him feel more comfortable in the game. It's a day-to-day work, and it's showing results. I was watching the post-match interview, and karrigan said he's back to micromanaging. What can you say about that and the changes to the system? When you get to the top, people study you. We got to a couple of finals recently and people were more aware of what we're doing, and we started changing small things. I would say things have got back to normal, finally. He's really good at in-game leading, he has done that in the past. He knows how to do it and that's when the team has played really well. He makes good calls but everyone can step up at some point and we all connect. You're now through to the playoffs. And we all know how good FaZe can be when you get into playoff mode. What kind of impact do you think that this victory can have on the team? And do you think that it can bring back some of the FaZe magic? Personally, I think we've seen some FaZe magic already, especially in this game. We've improved our game quite a lot, actually. We're playing good CS here, but I think winning like this is a huge boost. The competition is strong. NAVI is very stable, a great team. G2 has been having impressive results. And Vitality and MOUZ play really good CS, as always. So it won't be easy, but this kind of win gives us an extra boost of confidence, I guess."
Vitality send MOUZ to IEM Cologne quarter-final against G2,https://www.hltv.org/news/39614/vitality-send-mouz-to-iem-cologne-quarter-final-against-g2,"flameZ put on a show ending the series atop the board with a 1.49 rating.  Vitality won a complicated Group B upper bracket final against MOUZ and dodged a quarter-final series against the intimidating G2 in front of the crowd at the Lanxess Arena in the IEM Cologne quarter-finals. ""We want to focus on them,"" Shahar ""⁠flameZ⁠"" Shushan said of the group stage winners' bracket finals, a weak spot in Vitality's otherwise generally strong group stage performances, ""but we're actually clueless in some sense because it's in the consciousness. ""You don't know why but you just don't play them the same, so today we decided to come in with loads of energy in the beginning and just balance it throughout the game because it didn't work in the last games and the energy is where we needed to put our focus."" Vitality had issues in this very same match in this very same venue in 2023, albeit against G2 at the time, and also failed to clinch a semi-final berth in the upper bracket winners' match at IEM Dallas earlier this year, where 9z got the best of them. ""It's a happy thing that one year ago you were on this same platform and you couldn't finish this game against G2. Now it's MOUZ and this time around you come and don't make the same mistake. You come strong and play better teams, as well, so it's something I'm very excited about. Also the Lanxess Arena... I don't know how many fans are in this stadium but everyone loves Counter-Strike. Nobody comes for one team and only cheers for one team. It's one of the best experiences I've had as a player, people are just going to cheer for Counter-Strike."" Vitality's energy was felt from the get-go as Mathieu ""⁠ZywOo⁠"" Herbaut aced in the pistol round to put his team ahead in what would end up being a memorable one-sided affair that kept a goose egg on the board for MOUZ all the way up to halftime — not to mention three clutches going the way of the Ts. MOUZ did what they could on the attack to not get the embarrassing 0-13 and put six on the board before Vitality put up the inevitable winning round, and Vertigo would be where they would try and fight to bring the series back. Kamil ""⁠siuhy⁠"" Szkaradek and company looked like they were back in it and even led at the half on the attack, 7-5, but Vitality turned it around early on and even gave themselves three match points. Despite the lead and flameZ putting on a clinic, Vitality couldn't close it in regulation, but just as MOUZ's comeback had been in vain on Dust2, ZywOo and company were poised to take Vertigo in OT, 16-13, and bucked the trend of losing upper bracket finals with a 2-0 victory in the series."
IEM Cologne groups day 4 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39607/iem-cologne-groups-day-4-as-it-happened," Liquid 12-12  FaZe Absurd choke by Liquid, incredible play from FaZe, whatever you chalk this up to... what in the hell did we just witness? Helvijs ""⁠broky⁠"" Saukants must be ecstatic after flipping the bird after the second pistol round. Wiktor ""⁠TaZ⁠"" Wojtas posted on Twitter after receiving a warning from ESL for breaching the tournament's communication rules. Liquid 12-11  FaZe Liquid 12-8  FaZe This is getting close, with Liquid getting just six kills in the last four rounds. Can FaZe really bring this back to OT? Surely not after that first half and how early Liquid hit map point, but these recent rounds haven't been close. Liquid 11-1  FaZe Liquid can do no wrong. They are a step ahead in every single round, and I mean EVERY single round. Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak is 5:1 in opening duels, Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken is 17-4, and nothing is going FaZe's way at all. This is so over. Liquid 4-1  FaZe Liquid 2-0  FaZe Liquid 16-13  FaZe Vitality blundered three match points in regulation, but couldn't be stopped in overtime as they won four to MOUZ's one to get it over the line and secure their spot straight into the semis. Liquid 12-12  FaZe The most unlikeliest of resets after this map looked done, with Liquid barely scraping the win in round 24 after David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský nearly surprised from Squeaky in a 2v4. MOUZ 12-12  Vitality MOUZ and Vitality are stuck in after 24 rounds. Vitality had three match points on the attack, but could not convert as a strong defense in the end from Kamil ""⁠siuhy⁠"" Szkaradek and company kept it alive and into extra rounds. Liquid 10-12  FaZe FaZe's ticket to the LANXESS looked like it had been punched, but how in the hell have Liquid pulled this off to stay in it? Liquid 9-12  FaZe Liquid 9-11  FaZe David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský is having a field day in Mini, much to Liquid's dismay. The Slovakian rifler had a slow start on Nuke but has turned up on the CT side, grabbing two or more kills in all five of FaZe's round wins. Liquid 9-8  FaZe So it's going to be THAT kind of end to the map, is it? An MP9 from David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský punished Liquid's A hit and gave FaZe an early recovery from a pistol loss, Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken called another hit right back to steal away a round, and now Liquid have lost control again despite an incredible Ramp entry from Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic in an effort to recover a 3vs5. Liquid 6-6  FaZe MOUZ 7-5  Vitality Vitality had a dominant run early on, taking a 2-0 deficit and turning it into a 2-5 lead, but ultimately it was MOUZ who got ahead at the half after Ádám ""⁠torzsi⁠"" Torzsás won a 1vs1 to regain the lead in the 11th round before extending it to 7-5 at the switch. Liquid 6-3  FaZe Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak is having far more impact on Nuke already, pairing with Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic's Ramp holds and rotational support from Mareks ""⁠YEKINDAR⁠"" Gaļinskis to put Liquid ahead. FaZe got their third after hitting a perfect timing on YEKINDAR in a 3v3, but otherwise it's been a rainy day in Cedar Creek. Liquid 0-2  FaZe Håvard ""⁠rain⁠"" Nygaard did a crazy amount of damage while Helvijs ""⁠broky⁠"" Saukants did the clean-up, leading to a funny back-and-forth. Liquid 9-13  FaZe Liquid could have had a comeback there, gaining some steam off back-to-back multis from Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken and a near-hero hold from Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic on A. His triple kill wasn't enough to fully turn around a 3vs5, however, and FaZe cruised to a 13-9 finish in dominant fashion to go up 1-0 heading into their Nuke pick. David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský posted a 23-12 K-D and was almost unstoppable in Banana, while one of Liquid's best performers in Cologne, Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak, finished bottom of the board at 6-16. MOUZ 6-13  Vitality Six rounds was all MOUZ could muster. They will now hope to shake off their bad start on Vertigo, their map pick, where they have a shot at tying up the series. MOUZ 5-12  Vitality An ace from Mathieu ""⁠ZywOo⁠"" Herbaut set the stage for Vitality, who also won three clutches in the half, to dominate on the attack. So much so, that they didn't drop a single round. MOUZ won the second pistol round to keep it alive, but have a steep hill to climb before they'll even have a shot at bringing this one back. Liquid 7-11  FaZe Liquid 6-6  FaZe Not a pretty middle of the half for Liquid: They were ripped apart by David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský and Helvijs ""⁠broky⁠"" Saukants in defaults and early rounds, forcing a handful of saves and prompting a voice clip of Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic expressing his boredom while waiting. We're back to even keel at the break, though, thanks to Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken finding a gap in the defense with back-to-back A attacks. Liquid 4-6  FaZe Liquid 4-5  FaZe It's a rematch of one of the Group B opening matches for the final spot in LANXESS Arena, and it couldn't have been a better one: A showdown between Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken and his former teammates for elimination or glory, and a chance for the Canadian to claim revenge. Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen got the better of Liquid in that opening game, but it was in a narrow fashion: 13-11 Mirage, 13-10 Nuke. Liquid have changed things up in this veto, though, and opted for an Inferno pick instead. Mirage still came through as the decider, making this a good veto for Liquid too, but FaZe have far more tenure and experience on their side and have warmed up as the tournament has worn on. Natus Vincere 13-6  SAW SAW had left their options open trailing by two at the half, but there was no contest in the second half as Natus Vincere's attack completely overwhelmed SAW in a 6-1 half. Natus Vincere 7-5  SAW Natus Vincere took the pistol round, but were put on the back foot against SAW's second-round buy and took an early deficit. The favorites then found their footing on the CT side and regained the lead, 7-5 at the half, but just barely. There's plenty to be decided in the second half. ESL has confirmed that G2 coach Wiktor ""⁠TaZ⁠"" Wojtas received a warning during the elimination series against paiN after breaching the tournament's communication rules. While the first half was underway, the Polish coach was seen pointing at what appeared to be a strat sheet at the end of a round. 'We can confirm we are aware of the situation and can confirm that Taz received a warning as per our rulebook during the game vs paiN Gaming,"" ESL told HLTV and Dust2 Brasil in a statement. According to the ESL Pro Tour rulebook, coaches ""are not allowed to communicate in any other way including, but not limited to, shouting or non-verbal communication (e.g. touching) with players outside of the specified time windows."" The warning will stay in place for the remainder of the tournament. If TaZ is found in violation of the same rule again, he ""will be ejected from the game and forfeits [his] right to coach for the remainder of the match,"" per the rulebook. Natus Vincere 13-2  SAW Natus Vincere's speedrun of Ancient, where they quickly dispatched of SAW 13-2, has come to an end, but not before Mihai ""⁠iM⁠"" Ivan threw in a little extra with a knife kill on Ricardo ""⁠roman⁠"" Oliveira to add to his team's momentum as they head into the series' Inferno decider. Natus Vincere 10-2  SAW Valeriy ""⁠b1t⁠"" Vakhovskiy has been the X factor for Natus Vincere on Ancient, coming in big with clutches in the most important moments. His second now comes in an afterplant situation on the A site, where he won a 1vs2 to get his team to double digits at the half. Natus Vincere 6-2  SAW The map went back-and-forth four times since the start of Ancient by the time it was 4-2 for Natus Vincere. Aleksi ""⁠Aleksib⁠"" Virolainen and company are fighting to get back into series after dropping Nuke, but SAW are doing their best to stay in it from the start to try and find their footing on the CT side. Valeriy ""⁠b1t⁠"" Vakhovskiy finally put his foot down and won a massive 1vs4 to put his team in the driver's seat as they continue to put ground between themselves and their Portuguese by following up the clutch with a clean anti-eco to lead by four. G2 12-1  paiN G2 5-1  paiN It's insult to injury as Janusz ""⁠Snax⁠"" Pogorzelski keeps G2 well in control of Mirage, sitting with the knife on the smoked bomb. Natus Vincere 9-13  SAW It got scary in the end, but SAW just about held on to take the lead in the series on their pick. Natus Vincere started playing way too late and gave themselves no breathing room, with a fumbled 4v2 situation the final nail in their coffin. Natus Vincere 7-12  SAW Natus Vincere are hanging on by a thread, and they need a further five rounds to win to force overtime. Natus Vincere 3-7  SAW Natus Vincere 2-4  SAW Natus Vincere 2-3  SAW Just five rounds have been played so far, but SAW have taken the lead despite losing the pistol. Natus Vincere might not have it easy this time around. G2 7-1  paiN Lucas ""⁠nqz⁠"" Soares's 1v2 clutch remains the only round the Brazilians have won on the Terrorist side of Nuke, as G2 have won every other round convincingly, shutting down paiN's approaches before they even reach the bombsite. NiKo to BanKs on G2's run so far: ""I think we are on fire right now individually. We have now this capability of shutting out opponents and just smashing them because we are all very good individually."" On paiN: ""Maybe people think they are a bit worse than those two, but for us we're gonna approach them the same way we did Spirit and Astralis. They're hungry, they exceeded the expectations a bit, so we never know how they will react, but it's important that we treat them like we treated the last two opponents."" FaZe 13-6  Falcons That Five-Seven round was the turning point, FaZe didn't lose a single one after that. Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen and company will face off against Liquid for a playoff spot, while Falcons exit the tournament. FaZe 8-6  Falcons ""Despicable,"" says Hugo ""⁠Hugo⁠"" Byron. FaZe bullshit in full swing, and they are back in control after a back-and-forth map so far. Liquid close it with another huge run late, this time a 10-1 including the end of the first half and a flawless one on the T side. After getting that ace, Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak seemed to have gotten his confidence back and started to go for plays and returns to the top of the board for his team despite the rough start to the series on Ancient. It's the end of the road for Complexity, while Liquid might just get another shot at FaZe, who are leading Falcons in the other Group B game right now. FaZe 1-2  Falcons FaZe have won the first gun round with the help of Robin ""⁠ropz⁠"" Kool's 1v3, and Falcons' money is far from ideal in the next. FaZe 0-1  Falcons Complexity 4-5  Liquid And Liquid grab a lead on the CT side. Complexity 4-3  Liquid The game is heating up with Jonathan ""⁠EliGE⁠"" Jablonowski getting three openings around middle as Liquid tried to aggress down there, and Michael ""⁠Grim⁠"" Wince following it up with a 1v3 clutch, isolating the fights as he danced around the pillar. Complexity 2-2  Liquid Liquid have gone for this MP9 halfbuy a few times now and have been making it work. This time Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken finishes off the final 1v2 to put his team on he board with the less-than-ideal round three buy. Complexity 2-0  Liquid Two rounds in a row Ricky ""⁠floppy⁠"" Kemery turned at the last second to catch a sneaky Liquid player trying to make a play. Complexity survive the scary anti-eco for another early lead. FaZe 16-13  Falcons All they needed was Håvard ""⁠rain⁠"" Nygaard to start fragging again. The Norwegian found five kills across the overtime and helped FaZe put together a 4-1 streak to take the lead after Falcons' pick. Next up is FaZe's choice of Ancient. FaZe 15-13  Falcons It didn't end up making a difference, but FaZe have two more map points on Dust2. FaZe 12-12  Falcons That Helvijs ""⁠broky⁠"" Saukants clutch gave FaZe enough momentum to get to 12-9, but Falcons once again brought it back with a spirited comeback as Álvaro ""⁠SunPayus⁠"" García warmed up his AWP. Complexity 10-13  Liquid A final push saw Liquid win eight out of nine rounds and got them the victory on their Ancient pick. That Justin ""⁠jks⁠"" Savage 1v2 proved to be the turning point, as from there Liquid controlled the rest of the half. Another big early lead squandered by Complexity, who led 6-2 and 5-0 against MOUZ yesterday only to lose both maps. Complexity 10-8  Liquid It's back and forth as Complexity make a halfbuy fake work wonders but then cannot convert a 2v2 on B, with a Justin ""⁠jks⁠"" Savage spraydown making the difference. Clip: Complexity pull off a fake with pistols Clip: jks responds with a 1v2 spraydown FaZe 9-8  Falcons Complexity 9-7  Liquid Consecutive triples from Mareks ""⁠YEKINDAR⁠"" Gaļinskis are keeping Liquid in the map. His solo defense of B gave way to a 2v4 retake on A, a bit of a blunder from Complexity who didn't have anyone set up to trade. Complexity 7-5  Liquid Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic and Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken put in a crucial multi-kill each and Justin ""⁠jks⁠"" Savage clutched a 1v1 and got some crucial impact kills to help Liquid get to five at the half, making up for a rather quiet Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak so far. Complexity took advantage of that at the beginning of the half and also closed it out with two in a row, stacking A in the final round 4v5 to edge the half in their favor. FaZe 8-4  Falcons It looked terrible at the start, but Falcons got their T-side together and were competitive in the final few rounds. Their B attacks proved especially potent, with Marco ""⁠Snappi⁠"" Pfeiffer selling FaZe a dream with an impressive Long fake in the final round. FaZe 6-0  Falcons FaZe 5-0  Falcons That statline tell a lot about how the start of Dust2 is going. Three Falcons members are still yet to frag, while the FaZe side is firing on all cylinders. Complexity 3-1  Liquid Liquid didn't get away with a strong start despite their pistol win and getting the anti-force round down to a 4v3 on the B bombsite. There's not a lot of faith in Falcons and Complexity as they head into uphill matchups against the fan favorites of FaZe and Liquid. Here are the results of the poll: FaZe - 52% Liquid - 38% Falcons - 6% Complexity - 4% With the two teams featuring five North American players combined, it's a bit of a stretch to call Liquid vs. Complexity the NA derby, but I suppose the region needs all the representation it can get these days. Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken and company head into the matchup as favorites considering their solid track record so far with Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak and Justin ""⁠jks⁠"" Savage, but Complexity seem to be building their shaken confidence back at the tournament. That has been in no small part thanks to Jonathan ""⁠EliGE⁠"" Jablonowski, who has almost single-handedly made Complexity competitive with a 1.27 rating across the play-in and group stage. The veteran will however not be the best player on the server today judging by the form of Liquid's new awper, ultimate, sitting on a 1.34 rating in nine maps so far. On loss to Vitality in pre-match comment to sjokz: ""A couple of rounds and we could have been in the Cathedral already."" On general form: ""We've been struggling a but, but we're close to the top. We've stepped up a little bit yesterday and hopefully we're gonna have more of that today."" On the change in playstyle: ""It's like going back to the old FaZe days. Once you get to the top oeople study you, and you need to start cooking up a bit, but you don't want to overcook."" Spirit are in trouble, while SAW and Natus Vincere are loving life. Disagree with anything on the list? Marco ""⁠Snappi⁠"" Pfeiffer has been in a rotten run of form ever since the release of CS2, with his highest-rated event in the new game being a 0.95 at BetBoom Dacha Belgrade 2024, where his team made the semi-final. You need to go even further back to find his last 1+ rated event, IEM Dallas 2023, where he lifted the trophy with ENCE. In the Cologne group stage, however, the Danish tactician is leading the way for his team with a 1.07 rating and was especially impressive in yesterday's win against Virtus.pro, where he averaged a 1.20. Falcons face FaZe for elimination in the first round of games today, with the European combine also having a struggling Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen on the server (he is averaging a 0.78 rating in Cologne so far), so Snappi's form might just give Falcons the edge. Falcons' stats in the group stage: IEM Cologne's group stage has reached its final day. Two tickets to the playoffs are left up for grabs, one in each group. G2 and paiN will fight it out for a spot in LANXESS Arena in Group A, while in Group B four teams are still in the running — Falcons, FaZe, Liquid and Complexity — with two series wins separating them from a place on the quarter-finals. Meanwhile, two seeding games for a place in the semi-finals will be played between the four teams who have already secured their place in the playoffs: Natus Vincere vs. SAW and MOUZ vs. Vitality. Here's the full schedule of the day:"
FaZe to LANXESS after outrageous 1-11 comeback over Liquid,https://www.hltv.org/news/39616/faze-to-lanxess-after-outrageous-1-11-comeback-over-liquid,"karrigan's side pulled off an almost-impossible recovery on the Mirage decider to reach the arena.  FaZe have secured the final spot in the playoffs of IEM Cologne after completing one of the greatest comebacks to date in Counter-Strike 2, recovering from 1-11 and 3-12 deficits on the Mirage decider to scrape past Liquid in the Group B lower bracket final. Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen's side look revitalized in Cologne after a dismal few months of form, prompting questions about whether the German tournament was make-or-break for them. They edged past Liquid in their opener in a close two-map series before getting cast down to the lower bracket following a loss to Vitality, but have clawed back with wins over Falcons and a repeat victory over Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken's side, albeit in far closer fashion. karrigan spoke to the desk after the game to discuss FaZe's level coming into Cologne and what this result means, with the captain revealing that he has started micro-managing again after throwing the book out because nothing was working. ""I told the guys five days before the event that we are going to play some extra hours and we are going to throw the structure out of the boat. The way we've been playing, people are not finding the gaps, we're not [winning] individually, don't understand the full philosophy, we're not playing off each other, so now I'm back to micro-managing like we have a stand-in. ""It's very hard to call like that, it's mentally draining and my level is going to drop, but it has been dropped for the past few months anyway so if I can call us home getting some decent T sides, I'll do everything for us to win. We could go the the whole way, or we could go out in groups."" Liquid chose to pick Inferno instead of Mirage in the rematch, but the decision didn't pay off with David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský stamping his authority in Banana on both sides of the map and karrigan remaining a step ahead of Twistzz for much of the half. Two clutch rounds that Liquid failed to convert could've had a significant impact on the outcome, but FaZe ended up running away with the win, 13-9. Nuke offered far more excitement as Liquid romped out to an early lead, only for FaZe to claw back at the end of the first half from 3-6 to 6-6. Liquid struggled to break past FaZe's CT defenses after the side swap, with frozen finding a multi-kill in all of FaZe's round wins in a throttling halt of attacks on Mini and Upper. It looked over, then, when FaZe got a 5v3 in round 22 and had the perfect Ramp stack to counter an attack, but an absurd turnaround by Liquid flipped the round on its head and kept them in the game. That round acted as a rallying cry for Twistzz's troops as they seized firm control and powered through overtime to take the win, with Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak topping the charts with 32 frags and monumental impact in the final ten rounds. Clip: Liquid win ridiculous 3v5 to kickstart Nuke comeback That momentum carried into Mirage, where Liquid looked completely unstoppable. Nothing could go right for FaZe, Justin ""⁠jks⁠"" Savage won a 1v3 clutch with a sick spray transfer, and Liquid were a step ahead of FaZe in every single opening in a blowout 11-1 half. Anyone would have said it was over there, and even more so after Liquid won the first gun round to reach series point, 12-3. Helvijs ""⁠broky⁠"" Saukants flipping off Liquid after FaZe won the pistol round showed FaZe were still in good spirits and it would have been funny to look back on after the game, yet it just didn't seem to end. Liquid failed to seize control of bombsites even once after that, a masterclass defense of A by Håvard ""⁠rain⁠"" Nygaard and Robin ""⁠ropz⁠"" Kool providing no entry while Liquid's room in Middle went to waste as their splits were ripped apart in the late round. Clip: rain & ropz shut down A despite 4v5 That ludicrous turnaround saw FaZe bring things all the way back to overtime, winning nine rounds straight with no margin for error, and there they crushed Liquid's final hopes to lock in a LANXESS Arena berth. ""This is the calmest the TeamSpeak has been for the past four or five months, when we are down 11-1, everything is so calm,"" karrigan said of the comeback after the series. ""It kind of reminds me of the magic of 2022, we were just chilling, having fun, laughing it up and suddenly it's 12-11 like, 'Oops! We're back in town boys!'"""
IEM Cologne 2024 playoffs set with SAW amongst the elite,https://www.hltv.org/news/39617/iem-cologne-2024-playoffs-set-with-saw-amongst-the-elite,"NAVI and Vitality are straight through to the semi-finals.  Numbers one, three, four, five, six, and 19 in the world have come out the other side of the IEM Cologne group stage and will fight to bring home the trophy at the LANXESS Arena. Those are Natus Vincere, Vitality, G2, MOUZ, FaZe, and the surprise of the tournament, SAW. The No. 1 team in the world, Natus Vincere, are straight through to the semis after winning the Group A final against SAW. The Portuguese team were on a tear after beating G2 in the opening round and The MongolZ in the follow-up, and even went up 1-0 in the Group A upper bracket final before being brought back down to Earth in the last two maps of the series. Spirit, the second-highest-rated team, were also in Group A, but were knocked down to the lower bracket by The MongolZ in the opener and had the misfortune of facing G2, who bounced back and went on to secure the third playoff seed from the group, in the first round. Vitality made it to the semis from Group B by doing something rare for them: winning the group stage upper bracket final. MOUZ, the other finalist, now have the tough break of going into the arena against an explosive G2 side in the quarter-finals. FaZe secured the final berth in a three-map thriller against Liquid that went to overtime on two maps, and will face SAW in the playoffs. This will be a double-edged sword for a struggling team, as it could give them much-needed confidence or plummet them even further in self-doubt depending on the outcome. The playoff schedule and bracket is:"
"NiKo on not becoming IGL: ""I believed I could still be one of the best players in the world""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39615/niko-on-not-becoming-igl-i-believed-i-could-still-be-one-of-the-best-players-in-the-world,"The Bosnian superstar touched on his phenomenal form after G2 advanced to the playoffs of IEM Cologne.  Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač has weathered a slight dip in performance since the start of Counter-Strike 2, and now he's in a renaissance. The six-time top-five player in the world, considered by some as the best rifler of CS:GO, once spoke about his discomfort after the move to the new title. His performance dipped from a 1.2X average rating to 1.09 for the first three CS2 events in 2023, and increased marginally to 1.15 by IEM Chengdu. The Bosnian rifler started to find his footing at ESL Pro League Season 19, however, and pointed to the Maltese event as the turning point for his level while on the desk after G2 qualified for the playoffs in Cologne. ""I noticed that everything started to click [for me] during Malta EPL, from that event on I started to play better and better,"" NiKo said. From EPL on, NiKo has averaged a 1.23 rating, and ever since Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa and Janusz ""⁠Snax⁠"" Pogorzelski joined the team, he has looked like his best self with 1.35, 1.26, and 1.44-rated showings at EWC, BLAST Fall Groups, and Cologne. The thought that he could return to that level was a key factor in NiKo deciding not to transition to in-game leader during the tournament break, he revealed. ""One of the reasons why I didn't take over IGL when we were making changes was that I believed in myself, that I could still be one of the best players in the world, and I saw clear progress. ""I'm happy that I made this decision in the end and hopefully... I mean, it's pretty hard to keep up this level, but as long as I see progress in myself, that's very important for me. But I hope that people understand now why I didn't take over as IGL."""
HOLMES replaces Frøg as Endpoint coach,https://www.hltv.org/news/39619/holmes-replaces-frg-as-endpoint-coach,"The veteran Serb has been tasked with taking Endpoint back up the rankings after they missed out on the Shanghai Major cycle.  Petar ""⁠HOLMES⁠"" Dimitrijević is the new Endpoint coach, replacing Canadian Felix ""⁠Frøg⁠"" Bergeron. The 32-year-old former in-game leader has been active in the Serbian scene since 2015 (with a stint in Counter-Strike 1.6 from 2011-12 as well) and most recently appeared on LAN with iNation. He joined Endpoint on trial initially and impressed the team sufficiently to land the job full-time.

The two Copenhagen invites will be decided on August 25, in best-of-three 'finals', for each bracket. World No. 6 FaZe were sent to Showdown after being defeated by Ninjas in Pyjamas at Fall Groups, and there is potential for a rematch in the top-half of the first of two single-elimination eight-team brackets. Cloud9 and HEROIC have been drawn into the tricky top half of teams with FaZe and NIP, while Complexity, Virtus.pro, and Falcons are the highest-ranked teams in the bottom half of the bracket.

"NiKo: ""We will definitely be tested more in playoffs""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39620/niko-we-will-definitely-be-tested-more-in-playoffs,"NiKo is not getting carried away with the sublime form G2 showed to storm to an IEM Cologne playoff berth.  G2 have been revitalized since the additions of Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa and Janusz ""⁠Snax⁠"" Pogorzelski, kicking their season off with a run to the final of Esports World Cup, breezing through BLAST Fall Groups, and now making the playoffs of IEM Cologne. During this run, they have racked up a 19-7 map record. After opening their campaign in Germany with a shock defeat at the hands of SAW, G2 came roaring back with a vengeance, battering world No. 2 Spirit, handily dispatching Astralis, and walking over paiN to secure a playoff berth. In all bar one map, G2 limited their opposition to six rounds or less. Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač has been a key component of G2's resurgent showing in Cologne, such that he now sits atop the rating leaderboard for the tournament, sporting a 1.44 rating over nine maps. With a quarter-final bout against MOUZ on the horizon, NiKo sat down with HLTV to discuss G2's potential route to the final, their recent rivalry with Natus Vincere, and how the new signings have revitalized the team. You are through to the playoffs, but you have a very difficult route to the trophy. You are now facing MOUZ, then if you win that match you will face NAVI. What are your opinions on your chances? We definitely have tough opponents. Obviously you can't expect to have easy opponents in the playoffs, right? So it doesn't really matter, we are confident. We just have to do what we did in the group stage, and with MOUZ I think we have the upper hand to be honest, I think we will be favorites in that matchup. When it comes to NAVI, maybe it's a good thing we will be facing them in the semi-finals and not the final, maybe it will change something. They are definitely the hardest opponent for us, but we have to beat them at some point, so hopefully it will be this time. It has only been a couple of months since you brought in Snax and malbsMd. How do you think they are getting on with the team, and did you think that things would be this smooth right away? Things are great obviously, we are playing great and the results are there. Did I think it was going to be like this? Probably not. I don't think we are necessarily playing this good only because we brought them in, but the combination of having malbsMd's firepower and then me and huNter stepping up at the same time, I think those are the key reasons why we are smashing some opponents. Overall they brought a lot to our team, both Snax and malbsMd, and I just feel like we are having a really good time together on the server. We are enjoying playing together, we have a couple of things always ready, and we are not trying to complicate too much. Things are very smooth right now and hopefully we can build up on this and become even better. When malbsMd was brought in, there were some questions about roles. Do you think people were making it a bigger deal than it actually is? People will always talk shit, especially if they don't like the move, everyone jumps on the train and wants to hate as soon as possible. You just have to do your job and then win a couple of games, maybe an event, and they will shut up. That's pretty normal, the same happened when we brought Stewie2K in as a stand-in, everyone was talking shit and no one believed, we went out there and we won. No one said that they were wrong, but whatever. That is pretty normal in our community I would say. You've had some very good games here in Cologne. Looking at the opposition, you faced SAW, you faced a Spirit in crisis, you faced Astralis and now paiN. Are you worried that you haven't faced a top ten team [besides Spirit], a team that can give you a proper test? Definitely we will be tested, this will not go on all the time. We have obviously faced top ten teams, but I don't think it's any more them having a bad day, I think it's more us actually being very strong. I don't think it can be a coincidence it happens three days in a row, right? We will definitely be tested more in playoffs, hopefully not (laughs), but we are ready and we are talking about it all the time. I mentioned yesterday on the desk that the loss to Astralis was super important for us, there was a lot to take away from that game. We are ready, as I said we keep talking about it, if things go wrong how do we react to it, so we are ready. You mentioned yesterday on the broadcast that you decided not to become an IGL because you still think that you are an elite-level player. Can you walk me through that period, after you decided to move away from HooXi. Was it something you considered during that time? No, honestly it never crossed my mind. I was asked but from the very beginning I said that I didn't want to be IGL, it was very clear for me the way I want to continue my career, it was not the right time. As I said, I saw progress in my game, I knew what I could do, and I'm just very happy that it's showing right now. If you beat MOUZ, you are going to face NAVI. Are you looking forward to the chance to get back at them for what happened as Esports World Cup? Yeah, but it's one game at a time, MOUZ is a very important game for us. With NAVI it's not just the Riyadh match, there have been a couple of games we have lost to them that have been super important, at the Major for example. They can't keep beating us forever, it's going to stop. As I said it's tough, I think they're definitely playing the best Counter-Strike right now in the scene, they have the best structure and their players are stepping up as well, it's always someone else who is playing very well. They are a hard team to beat. We were very close a couple of times but we always messed up some things, so I look forward to getting another shot to play against them. If we get another shot, one thing is for sure, it's going to be a very cool game that everyone should enjoy. Do you think, looking at the bracket, that NAVI are the toughest team you can get in this tournament? Personally for us, definitely. I think if we overcome NAVI, I don't see a tougher opponent for us. What would it mean for you to win Cologne once again after doing it last year? I think it would be cool, I don't have too many of those prestigious trophies so I really want to start winning those. It would be very cool to win another one."
"ropz: ""People look at me like I'm s1mple, ZywOo, or donk, but I'm not""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39622/ropz-people-look-at-me-like-im-s1mple-zywoo-or-donk-but-im-not,"""I never asked to be a star player, I'm just a guy who is fine being a stable rock for the team,"" added the Estonian.  FaZe have been in a slump ever since Vitality ended their grand-final streak at ESL Pro League Season 19 in the top-eight stage, and early exits at the Esports World Cup and BLAST Premier Fall Groups 2024 have done little to change the narrative. Their lacklustre form meant the team led by Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen came into Cologne with an outside chance for the title, but no one considered them the main favorites. Despite that, FaZe have shown improved form in Cologne and beat Falcons and Liquid to make the playoffs, with their second victory against Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken and company containing a historic 1-11 comeback. Robin ""⁠ropz⁠"" Kool, whose team will face off against SAW in the quarter-finals, spoke to HLTV ahead of the playoffs and talked about FaZe's road to the top-six, his individual form, and the general state of CS2. ropz, you are through to the playoffs after a very close and hectic series. What went through your head during that game? It's hard to say, there were a lot of different things. The end of Nuke against Liquid was tough, we all felt like we should have won, and the match could have ended 2-0. But we've learned from our past mistakes, we've had many rough losses in the past few tournaments. The one thing we can take away is that we are staying more positive after each loss, and that's helping us. We found a way to reset for Mirage, even though it didn't look like that on paper, but we went into Mirage with positive vibes. We didn't have a great start there, that's for sure, but we remained calm. You saw it after the pistol round, we were all happy and showing it, so I think that's a nice development and something that took us over the line. The comms and everything, they were calm, almost too calm for FaZe, I would say, because it's quite hectic sometimes. And throughout the whole CT side, it felt like they were just pressured to close it out, and we were just waiting for them to make the mistakes. You are now going to face SAW. If you beat them, you will match up with Vitality in the semifinals. Are you confident about your playoff chances in Cologne? We are very confident. Even in the match against Vitality, we could have won 2-0 after we took them to overtime on Dust2. I felt like we had a chance there to close it out. The rounds on Anubis against Vitality were really close, a couple of clutches there, which they won. So far, [we have had] very promising results here in Cologne, and we'll just see how the playoffs go. If we get activated in the playoffs like we usually did in the past, we are definitely aiming for a trophy. You had a very good performance on the last map yesterday, and we have seen some more stability coming out of you in this tournament. What can you say about your slump and how you've been dealing with that? I mean, it's just a regular slump. People look at me like I'm s1mple, ZywOo, or donk, but I'm not one of them, definitely not. I never said I am, and I never asked to be a star player. I'm just a guy who is fine to be a stable rock for the team and provides consistency when it matters. And to get a performance like that when the team needed you most, would you say that it is a confidence boost for you? For sure. Closing out Mirage like that and getting some impact rounds in the comeback felt good. And with each round that went on, I felt like I was getting more into the game and just feeling it more and more. So that was definitely nice. After the match, karrigan said that he's back to micromanaging. What can you say about the impact that this had on the team's game? And does this suit you better? It's tough to say if it suits us better. Obviously, it comes down to the scenario we find ourselves in. It is a way that karrigan calls sometimes, he used to do it in MOUZ, and he used to do it with stand-ins in FaZe. When things are not so set in stone, we have to play more structured to get the trades going, because I think trading has been a big problem for our T sides. So now with karrigan just taking over a bit more, we are moving more as a pack and as a unit. I think getting those trades down is going to help us. You've been very critical about the current state of CS2, and SPUNJ said you had a list of things you wanted Valve to change. What is your opinion about the current state of the game, and do you think that this has played a role in some of your struggles in recent weeks and months? It's in a strange place right now. I'm not sure it has to do anything with my struggles, maybe a bit with motivation, but not much. I think there are many poor things happening right now. FPS issues are one of the biggest things. I am a native user, 1920, so I think you take a pretty big hit sometimes on the practice PCs. We have pretty good PCs here in ESL or IEM Cologne, and other tournaments as well, but it's just not enough for CS2. When you play on 360Hz monitors, you expect 360 FPS running all the time, but you don't really get that nowadays. You need to have the best of the best PCs to do that, and I feel like we get that in the tournament setup, but not in the practice setup, so that's where you get hurt a bit. There are some more things with CS2, definitely, MR12 and the economy are some things I will mention, and I'll leave it there. There are some smaller things, but I'll leave it there. Do you think Valve are open to discussing these things? They're improving FPS with each update, I feel like they're trying, at least, even though it has gone down from the data I've seen. FPS is something they'll always look at, you know, to improve, but I'm not sure what their opinion is. Some say humans can only see 60Hz per second or whatever, and some say more, so I don't know. I mean, the MR12 and the economy thing, it's also something that might change, or it might not, you never know with Valve. Someone might be thinking of a great solution, but maybe actually nothing is happening there, so we'll never know. You guys are now through to the playoffs. We all know how good FaZe can be when you get into playoff mode. What is the minimum goal here? Or are you guys just taking it as a bonus? That's a good question, actually. When we came into this tournament, karrigan mentioned that inside the team, we come here with no pressure. In a way, we lowered the expectations. For us, the expectation has always been to win the trophy, but here, we're just trying to show the best FaZe of recent times, at least. Make a playoff appearance at a minimum and just take it from there, and so far, we've done exactly what we wanted. Now we can think about the trophy, but coming into the tournament, we set ourselves lower goals because we needed to take a step back, and I think it has worked so far."
Vitality through to LANXESS after FaZe win,https://www.hltv.org/news/39601/vitality-through-to-lanxess-after-faze-win,"FaZe drop down to the lower bracket to play Falcons.  Vitality have defeated FaZe in a close-fought three-map series (Inferno 8-13, Dust2 16-12, Anubis 13-9) to secure a spot in the IEM Cologne playoffs. The game was decided in small details, with Vitality winning a second-round forcebuy after losing the pistol three times across the series. A couple of 1v1 clutches by Shahar ""⁠flameZ⁠"" Shushan and Lotan ""⁠Spinx⁠"" Giladi were also crucial in helping the team take control of Anubis late. ""When I was planting the bomb I heard my heartbeat, and I don't like that. But I'm happy I won it, it was a stressful one,"" flameZ described his clutch in a post-match interview. For FaZe, this isn't the end of their Cologne campaign yet. The European combine came into the event in dire form, with Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen admitting he is ""ready to risk everything to win the whole thing."" While they weren't able to win, their performance against a top-six side was an encouraging one, as a few clutches could have turned the tide and helped them move to the playoffs. FaZe now drop down to the lower bracket to face Falcons, while Vitality will play MOUZ for a semi-final spot. The series began on Inferno, where FaZe's aggressive economic decisions meant they prevailed in the opening force-buy wars and ran away to a 9-3 lead in the first half. Vitality then won a second-round force buy on their offense but ran out of steam before they could worry the FaZe side, who took the series lead with a 13-8 win. Clip: FaZe turn 2v5 to find nine rounds on offense Vitality went for a Dust2 pick and started the map in hot form to take an early 8-1 lead, but a resilient FaZe put together a three-round streak to end the half. That gave them the platform to secure overtime despite fumbling against an eco, before Vitality turned the tide in overtime and won four straight rounds to take the map 16-12. Clip: apEX 1v2 helps Vitality win eco Anubis was another high-octane map of Counter-Strike. FaZe took an 8-6 lead after their second pistol victory of the map with the help of Håvard ""⁠rain⁠"" Nygaard's 7:1 opening duel success, but couldn't hold on to their lead. flameZ won a crucial 1v1 against Helvijs ""⁠broky⁠"" Saukants late on, which got Vitality the upper hand in the economy alongside a spot in the LANXESS."
"xertioN on facing Vitality: ""A good match to test our level""",https://www.hltv.org/news/39600/xertion-on-facing-vitality-a-good-match-to-test-our-level,"The Israeli opener isn't worried that his team has looked a bit off the pace at times in Cologne.  MOUZ have punched their ticket to the playoff stage of IEM Cologne 2024 after beating Complexity 2-0 in Group B's upper semi-finals. It marks the team's return to the LANXESS arena after they missed out on a playoff spot last year. The EPL 19 champions are now set to face Vitality in a seeding match, with the winner skipping the first round of the playoffs and going straight to the semi-finals. After the match against Complexity, Dorian ""⁠xertioN⁠"" Berman sat down with HLTV and discussed the team's slow starts in Cologne, the preparation for the event, and his playoff expectations. A 2-0 victory against Complexity and you're through to the LANXESS for the first time in your career. With MOUZ being a German organization, how important was it for the team to make it into the playoffs? Very, especially after last year's failure. I think everyone on the team felt really bad, for us but also for the organization, because they've done everything to give us a good system and a new facility that we can now practice in. They're doing all the right things, so I'm just happy to pay back a bit. Talking a little bit about the series, Vertigo was looking a little bit shaky at first. They had that 5-0 start, but then, you got into your stride and you took control of the game, pretty much. Sometimes, we have some slow starts as a team. It happens quite frequently and it's something we're working on. Against Falcons, it was better. A bit of an off-start, I would say, but once we got into our groove, we showed that we are a better team than them, and I think that everyone played really well today. Nuke was a very close game, but you pulled through in the end. Did you expect such a tight game? Yeah, of course. Complexity are always tough to play against, they're really good. I'm a big fan of EliGE, I think he's a great player. Today, it was kind of tough for me, I felt a little bit out of it. I'm just happy that my team pulled through and happy to win, even though I didn't play my best. Are you worried that some of the games that you have played here haven't been very clean? No, I think that everyone is having some scrappy games at the top level. I think there is no best team in the world at this moment. Obviously, we want to be so in the future, but there is a lot of work ahead of us for us to achieve it. We're going to take it step by step. Bad game or whatever, we've still won two games. There are even teams like Spirit that are already out, which is incredibly surprising. Just take it step by step and move forward. Most of the teams here came straight from the BLAST Fall Groups, but that was not your case. You had, like, three weeks to prepare for this tournament. What did you work on? And are you happy that you had all that extra time to prepare for this event? What we worked on is a bit of a secret, but I think we put in really good work coming into here. We also had a really good bootcamp, we had some good talks with each other, some team bonding with our sports psychologist. In general, I think it's just nice to have the bootcamp facility of MOUZ now because it kind of feels like a second home at this point already. I think we did all the right things, and I just hope to keep showing it, we have a seeding game, and after that in the LANXESS arena. Yesterday against Falcons, you had a very strong start to the series with a very one-sided new game, and torzsi had that team kill towards the end. But the series ended up being a very close one. Do you think that maybe you underestimated them a little bit after that easy first game? Not too much. Mentally, I think it's always difficult to reset to the mindset of that they're a really good team because we won the first map very convincingly. But we knew they're a really scrappy team and that they can always bring back rounds. They have a lot of experienced players. It happened, but I think overall we were just prepared to win. Heading into this event, most people would put Spirit, G2 and NAVI as the favorites. Spirit are already out. What do you think about your chances in the playoffs? Because there's always that question of whether you guys can do it on the big stage. I think everyone has the same chance. Whoever deserves it more and puts in the better work will win the tournament. I'm not really thinking about it in this moment. I just want to take it step by step and show up as a team every single game. It doesn't matter if it's in a quarter-final or semi-final. Hopefully, we make it as far as we can. Overall, I'm just looking forward to playing there. You're now going to play the winner of FaZe vs Vitality. What are your expectations for this seeding match? I think it's in the third map now, it's like 8-8 or something. It's always a brawl between these two teams. I'm not sure what to expect. We will gladly take on either team. I think it's going to be a good match to test our level at this point. They are two very good teams. Looking forward to facing whoever."
G2 continue Cologne resurgence with Astralis win,https://www.hltv.org/news/39602/g2-continue-cologne-resurgence-with-astralis-win,"Two dominant showings on Dust2 and Ancient were enough to keep G2 in the tournament.  G2 have eliminated Astralis from IEM Cologne after defeating the Danes in a three-map series (Dust2 13-1, Mirage 9-13, Ancient 13-3). Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač and company will now face off against the winner of The MongolZ vs. paiN for a playoff spot. Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa, who topped the server in the series, was in a joyous mood in the post-match interview. ""I'm doing my best to make it to the stage, so I'm happy and super proud,"" he said. ""I don't feel any pressure because the boys made me feel comfortable. Anchoring isn't that strange to me, but I still need to get used to it and learn when to go aggressive."" The win continues G2's impressive return to form after their opening loss to SAW. They demolished Spirit on Sunday and were utterly dominant on two of the three maps against Astralis. G2's stats since SAW loss: Astralis, who won 2 out of the first 21 rounds in the series, exit IEM Cologne after a couple of lackluster performances. They followed their opening win against 9z by being outclassed on four out of five maps against Natus Vincere and G2 and thus suffered an early elimination. Their CT sides have been especially woeful, as they averaged a 34.4% win rate in Cologne despite a comfortable opening victory. ""They outclassed us today,"" said a distraught Nicolai ""⁠device⁠"" Reedtz in the post-match interview. ""No excuses, just not good enough. A lot of responsibility is on me in terms of putting the guys in better situations and finding the path we need to take. I don't have the answers right now, but we need to change something in our approach to the game."" The series began with G2 demolishing Astralis on the Dane's pick of Dust2, with NiKo and company even having some fun and getting a couple of knife kills. Clip: NiKo demolishes Astralis in second-half pistol Next up was Mirage, where Astralis completed a miraculous turnaround from 1-6 down on the CT side. Martin ""⁠stavn⁠"" Lund and device in particular had a resurgence on the offense, and the Danes looked like an entirely different team all of a sudden to put together a 9-2 T side and close out a 13-9 victory. G2 returned to their best on Ancient, however, and pummeled an Astralis side devoid of confidence into the ground in a 13-3 victory to eliminate the Danes from IEM Cologne in 9-12th place.

IEM Cologne groups day 3 as it happened,https://www.hltv.org/news/39594/iem-cologne-groups-day-3-as-it-happened," The MongolZ 6-12  paiN The MongolZ 6-10  paiN The MongolZ 6-7  paiN The MongolZ 6-6  paiN There was little doubt in mind that the chaos would stop in this series after those first two maps, and rest assured, it has not. Three 1vX clutches in the first half alone, an early force-buy war, and narrow margins have kept this game close, but its paiN who head into the second half with the mental edge after sweeping the last four rounds to recover from 2-6 down. I'll let you figure that one out on your own. Hint: it has something to do with beating Martin ""⁠stavn⁠"" Lund. G2 13-3  Astralis Another clinic by G2 keeps them alive in Cologne, while Astralis exit the tournament with a whimper after a couple of terrible CT sides. The MongolZ 4-2  paiN G2 9-3  Astralis G2 look like the team from Dust2, nothing is working for Astralis once again, and Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa is just running around headshotting people. This one might be over. G2 4-2  Astralis G2 3-2  Astralis The MongolZ 10-13  paiN That may be one of the most chaotic, highlight-filled, exciting, and messy maps of Counter-Strike I've watched in a long time, and we could be in for another as paiN have forced a Nuke decider. By no means should we be in this position, given the late back-and-forth and The MongolZ's ballsy force-buy, but that clutch from Rodrigo ""⁠biguzera⁠"" Bittencourt will haunt them for a long time if they are eliminated after this. G2 3-1  Astralis Astralis never stood a chance. The MongolZ 10-12  paiN What a ballsy call from Garidmagnai ""⁠bLitz⁠"" Byambasuren to force with MP9s there, and it paid off — at least until they completely threw it away with a disastrously played 3vs1. The MongolZ 10-10  paiN The MongolZ 8-6  paiN G2 9-13  Astralis Astralis, who won 12 rounds in their last three maps in Cologne, have turned around a 1-6 deficit to take Mirage. Martin ""⁠stavn⁠"" Lund and Nicolai ""⁠device⁠"" Reedtz in particular had a resurgence on the offense, and the Danes looked like an entirely different team all of a sudden to put together a 9-2 T side. It feels like they will have the upper hand on Ancient in terms of morale, too. This is the kind of mental resilience I expect from my FACEIT teammates. The MongolZ 6-6  paiN A very back-and-forth half thus far, filled with individual highlights and some great teamplay to create space. Every single round feels like it's been close and within reach for both sides, but it's MongolZ who head into the second half with a win after Usukhbayar ""⁠910⁠"" Banzragch cracked open B in round 12 to tie the score. G2 10-12  Astralis G2 9-9  Astralis Astralis have shown some incredible mental to bring this back to even. Their teamplay is back and so is their aim, while G2 have just burned through their last timeout on the map. G2 9-8  Astralis The MongolZ 2-4  paiN G2 8-6  Astralis A lot more is needed, but Astralis' B attack in the pistol started them on the right foot. The MongolZ 1-3  paiN G2 6-3  Astralis Astralis have shown signs of life for the first time in the series by winning two consecutive rounds, and G2 are down to an eco in the next. G2 4-1  Astralis It's not looking any better on Mirage for Astralis, even their round wins look bad. The MongolZ 16-13  paiN It should never have been that close, but at least we got a thrilling map out of it. From a chess match to a brawl, overtime was all individuals. The MongolZ swept the CT side, with Kaue ""⁠kauez⁠"" Kaschuk spraying down four to briefly keep paiN alive after the side swap before an A execute closed out the map. The MongolZ's pick of Mirage is next. The MongolZ 15-12  paiN G2 1-0  Astralis The MongolZ 12-12  paiN The MongolZ 12-10  paiN Somehow, this has gotten close. paiN won the pistol and conversion, but it was looking done after The MongolZ won three in a row in dominant fashion to hit map point. But Rodrigo ""⁠biguzera⁠"" Bittencourt is calling a masterclass right now, and this game is suddenly exciting with overtime on the horizon. Just like that, G2 take the lead in the series. Astralis will need some fresh air after this one. It's still 0-0 lads. He has a point, to be fair. G2 11-1  Astralis Victor ""⁠Staehr⁠"" Staehr is not having a good time, and neither are his teammates. G2 7-0  Astralis G2 6-0  Astralis Another quick win for incoming for G2? They seem to be feeling it, and Ilya ""⁠m0NESY⁠"" Osipov just knifed Alexander ""⁠br0⁠"" Bro. The MongolZ 9-3  paiN That was a brutal half for paiN on their Anubis pick, a quad kill round from Rodrigo ""⁠biguzera⁠"" Bittencourt and triple from Kaue ""⁠kauez⁠"" Kaschuk being all they had to their name until the last round of the half. Ayush ""⁠mzinho⁠"" Batbold is fired up and is all smiles while shouting across the hall... what he's saying is anyone's guess, but there's no denying it's fun to see. Another 1v1 (this one by Lotan ""⁠Spinx⁠"" Giladi) goes the way of Vitality in the final round, and Vitality are in the LANXESS. It was an exciting game of Counter-Strike between two heavyweights, and FaZe did look better than their recent performances. FaZe 9-10  Vitality Now Vitality take a one-round lead, and FaZe are out of money. FaZe 9-8  Vitality Some classic FaZe bullshit late on Anubis, and FaZe have just kept their nose ahead after winning an unlikely round. A kick in the teeth for Complexity, who couldn't close out Nuke despite having the economic and positional advantage in rounds at the end of the map. MOUZ 11-11  Complexity MOUZ 9-11 Complexity Complexity are exploiting Door and looking like they could well force a third map, despite some well-timed pushes from MOUZ. FaZe 6-6  Vitality Vitality will be more than happy about posting six on the notoriously difficult Anubis CT side. The right players are on top of the scoreboard, too, as Lotan ""⁠Spinx⁠"" Giladi (12 kills) and Mathieu ""⁠ZywOo⁠"" Herbaut (11) lead the way. MOUZ 8-8  Complexity FaZe 2-3  Vitality Would have worked if Mathieu ""⁠ZywOo⁠"" Herbaut found the bomb a bit quicker. MOUZ 6-6  Complexity Save for Jimi ""⁠Jimpphat⁠"" Salo's triple and a second-round force-buy win, MOUZ didn't have an ideal start to their map pick. Attempts to abuse Ricky ""⁠floppy⁠"" Kemery at Ramp went wayward, and when MOUZ tried to change the pace with an A site execute, a missed Hut Molotov spelled their doom and allowed floppy to find another multi-kill. Kamil ""⁠siuhy⁠"" Szkaradek was not dissuaded, however, and called an A site rush immediately after, and that half-buy win helped the European team steal away momentum and win the final four of the half. FaZe 1-1  Vitality MOUZ 1-3  Complexity FaZe 12-16  Vitality FaZe ran out of steam in overtime and allowed Vitality to run away with the map, 16-12. William ""⁠mezii⁠"" Merriman and Lotan ""⁠Spinx⁠"" Giladi locked down the B site and built a great platform for an explosive B attack on the T side, which proved enough to tie up the series. On to Anubis! FaZe 12-12  Vitality After being 1-8 down on the CT side, FaZe came back to force overtime on Dust2. Game on! MOUZ 13-9  Complexity From 0-5 to 11-5, MOUZ had their way with Complexity for much of this map after a slow start. A pistol clutch from Jimi ""⁠Jimpphat⁠"" Salo in the second half increased their seven-round streak from the first half to 11, and a late resurgence from Complexity came too little, too late with Kamil ""⁠siuhy⁠"" Szkaradek finding impactful entries to help MOUZ close. We're headed to Nuke next. FaZe 7-10  Vitality FaZe 6-9  Vitality FaZe 4-8  Vitality A three-round streak by FaZe gives them somethinfg to work with, but it hasn't been a great showing by Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen and company. MOUZ 7-5  Complexity Complexity's hot start is a distant memory already after MOUZ won all remaining rounds in the first half, starting their streak with a half-buy robbery and continuing it with multis from Jimi ""⁠Jimpphat⁠"" Salo and Ádám ""⁠torzsi⁠"" Torzsás. Jonathan ""⁠EliGE⁠"" Jablonowski went from 7-1 to 8-8, with his attempts to force the issue at Ramp faltering once Ludvig ""⁠Brollan⁠"" Brolin got on the board and MOUZ put some more support around him. FaZe 1-5  Vitality Dan ""⁠apEX⁠"" Madesclaire is leading the way for Vitality, with the French captain sitting on five kills — four of which have been entries. MOUZ 0-5  Complexity Jonathan ""⁠EliGE⁠"" Jablonowski is having his way with Ludvig ""⁠Brollan⁠"" Brolin on Vertigo's A Ramp right now, the former sitting upon a 7-1 K-D while the Swede is kill-less five rounds in. FaZe 0-1  Vitality FaZe 13-8  Vitality FaZe made it work with some less-than-ideal buys for their final two rounds and close it before it gets any more dangerous on their own pick. They're just one map away from LANXESS now, with Dust2 up next. FaZe 11-6  Vitality Another second-round forcebuy went the way of Vitality, but FaZe have stopped the rot early thanks to this stalwart defense of B from Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen: Not much in terms of soundbites, but this interview speaks volumes about Virtus.pro's mental state. Changes inc? Five losses in a row for Denis ""⁠electroNic⁠"" Sharipov's Virtus.pro, and another 13-16th placed exit. Falcons now march on to face the loser of FaZe-Vitality. FaZe 9-3  Vitality Inferno began with up 3-2 after they won the second-round forcebuy and a couple of clutches from Mathieu ""⁠ZywOo⁠"" Herbaut, but couldn't make the landing stick in a 5v3 up against an apps explosion from FaZe in the following round. From there FaZe went on a seven-round run. Robin ""⁠ropz⁠"" Kool dominated around apps and David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský found some key entries to kick off the streak, and it ended with Helvijs ""⁠broky⁠"" Saukants and Håvard ""⁠rain⁠"" Nygaard turning a 2v5 on B. Falcons 10-7  Virtus.pro Falcons have recovered from bad starts to halves twice on Dust2, doing what they couldn't on Mirage. A true team performance helping them there too, with most of the round timer spent on hunts around the map for VP's saving players. Falcons 5-4  Virtus.pro The flying USP from Peter ""⁠dupreeh⁠"" Rasmussen! Falcons 1-3  Virtus.pro But like last map, Pavle ""⁠Maden⁠"" Bošković's team are not doing too hot so far. The Montenegran has five kills in two rounds but Falcons need more. NAF to sjokz on ultimate: ""He's a super confident AWPer, super aggressive as everyone can see. I'm happy he's making a good name for himself. A lot of times when players come in they're a little nervous and they start a little slow, and then people start to doubt them. But he's playing with full confidence and he's playing well."" On resilience and mentality after going down on Dust2: ""There's been a lot of games where we were having struggles, and we took a timeout to say, 'We just need to start playing a little bit more aggressive, in their face, and confident. That's pretty much what happened when we were down 11-8 on Dust2. mithR took a timeout and just said, 'Guys, we're playing like a bunch of pussies, we need to start getting aggressive.'"" Liquid 13-4  FURIA Liquid deal FURIA a tough blow to go along with their early group stage elimination. Both pistol rounds won, and yet the Brazilians only came away with four rounds in total. It was a struggle from beginning to end up against a Liquid squad that was more than ready to brawl ever since Dust2 reached the late stages. What on earth did we just watch. Pavle ""⁠Maden⁠"" Bošković was on a tear, but constant force buys and hero AKs allowed VP back into the game and Falcons end Mirage with ZERO T rounds. Dust2 will decide. Falcons 8-8  Virtus.pro It's a 6-1 scoreline in the last seven as VP rally on Mirage. It helps that Falcons did just enough damage to keep forcing, and their lead is gone as they buy up fully for the first time as T. FURIA 2-10  Liquid It all began with that half-ass buy lobby crunch and it's ended in a round that Felipe ""⁠skullz⁠"" Medeiros and Kaike ""⁠KSCERATO⁠"" Cerato went into with zero money in the bank after they were hunted down trying to save, after time ran out. This has been a brutal clinic from Liquid. FURIA 2-7  Liquid Liquid have been playing in FURIA's faces all half long and there has been no response from the Brazilians for the past seven rounds. Preventing the early aggression has proved impossible, and FURIA look completely out of this game now. FURIA 2-2  Liquid Liquid went for a rather curious halfbuy with some MP9s and went for a lobby crunch with it, and in the end Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken clutched a 1v2 to convert the round. This buy is something similar we saw from FURIA earlier in the tournament, and Eternal Fire as well. Falcons 7-2  Virtus.pro Emil ""⁠Magisk⁠"" Reif should've known what he was getting into trying to flank Dzhami ""⁠Jame⁠"" Ali in a 4v1, but still finds time to shout across at Mr. Supersaver Falcons 4-1  Virtus.pro A proactive Falcons are disrupting VP early on in map two, and the constant mid pushes and flanks are working — but they let go of a 4v2 here. Liquid went back to their brawly nature once the game hit overtime and ran with the chaos, securing the first map despite the horrid start on the CT side. As has been custom for Liquid in Cologne so far, Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak ends the map on top of the scoreboard again. The Pole was running around the map making himself difficult to predict, and it was working for him more often than not. We all thought Vertigo would become more T sided after the changes, but that has not quite materialised in practice — until now. CT sides have struggled immensely in Cologne, particularly Virtus.pro's. ""Sometimes we're struggling, especially on Vertigo,"" admitted David ""⁠n0rb3r7⁠"" Danielyan pre-game and that has continued. Mirage next. Liquid 15-12  FURIA Complete chaos ensued in the final round of the first OT half as Liquid re-aggress and then double down on the re-aggress and re-aggress again, everywhere, all the time. And it works. Falcons 13-11  Virtus.pro That's a 10 round T half for Falcons and how fitting that Emil ""⁠Magisk⁠"" Reif — who struggled immensely on B on CT — closes it out with a quad kill in the 3on5 clutch. Liquid 14-12  FURIA A double AWP setup on long and it's Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic, not Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak getting all the kills. Liquid 12-12  FURIA With Twistzz adding on a quad-kill to YEKINDAR's triple, Liquid were on the recovery mission but failed to convert a match point in the final round of regulation as their aggressive moves on long and short didn't pan out. Falcons 9-11  Virtus.pro VP finally won two CT rounds, but they're snapped straight back with a Marco ""⁠Snappi⁠"" Pfeiffer clutch on B. Liquid 9-11  FURIA A seven-round streak is brought to an end as FURIA's double AWP buy on the Terrorist side doesn't work out. Falcons 7-9  Virtus.pro The T sided nature of the new Vertigo continues, and Falcons are looking far better since the side swap all over the map. Even Emil ""⁠Magisk⁠"" Reif is trending up, with a triple kill on an anti-eco and a 1on2 clutch here. Liquid 8-9  FURIA Felipe ""⁠skullz⁠"" Medeiros is on 14 kills in five rounds in the second half now. Liquid 8-8  FURIA He was having a slow start to the game on the CT side, but Felipe ""⁠skullz⁠"" Medeiros has now racked up four multi-kills in a row — some against ecos, of course, but one could have gotten hairy — and the game is even now. Falcons 2-8  Virtus.pro Falcons have no answer on B. The only round they won was when VP went A, and Álvaro ""⁠SunPayus⁠"" García got a triple from Sandbags. Peter ""⁠dupreeh⁠"" Rasmussen and Emil ""⁠Magisk⁠"" Reif are having a nightmare, and Petr ""⁠fame⁠"" Bolyshev is the one behind it. Liquid 7-4  FURIA I guess nobody was looking at the time, or Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken didn't realize he had the bomb? Falcons 1-5  Virtus.pro Emil ""⁠Magisk⁠"" Reif and Peter ""⁠dupreeh⁠"" Rasmussen are having to fight blind and burning on B as Virtus.pro hit them with execute after execute. Big lead already. Liquid 5-3  FURIA Gabriel ""⁠FalleN⁠"" Toledo has come to play early as he is roaming around middle with the AWP with a lot of success, as his collateral in round 7 and a double in a B retake giving FURIA a way back in. Liquid 5-1  FURIA The game is beginning to run away from the Brazilians with Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak already making his presence known with an AWP triple in the first gunround. Meanwhile, Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic is having fun with his former teammate as he caught him from behind with a knife. Liquid 2-1  FURIA Marcelo ""⁠chelo⁠"" Cespedes's quad-kill in a B retake gave Brazilians the pistol and then went for an AWP purchase in round two while the rest of his team went for some MP9s. Their aggressive push up middle backfired, and so did the AWP purchase as chelo missed a crucial kill in a B defense. At least the AWP didn't land in Liquid's hands in the end. 13-6 to Complexity on Vertigo yesterday, and Falcons look to punish VP by picking it into them. Virtus.pro now face Falcons, who they lost to at BB Dacha. David ""⁠n0rb3r7⁠"" Danielyan was withdrawn in his pre-game interview as VP still struggle to merge the style of Denis ""⁠electroNic⁠"" Sharipov and what was there before. Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken apparently took some inspiration from FURIA on Nuke. The map will see play again after FURIA picked it despite the loss in their first matchup in the play-in. On the other side, though, Twistzz opted for a different pick: Dust2 instead of Anubis. Mirage to decide like last time. FURIA were no match for Mathieu ""⁠ZywOo⁠"" Herbaut and company yesterday as they won a combined five rounds over two maps. This time, they're going up against Liquid, whom they've already faced once before at the tournament just four days ago. The first time around, the Brazilians came within touching distance of the win only to see it slip. Can they take their revenge today? Welcome to our live coverage of the third day of IEM Cologne's group stage. After Natus Vincere and SAW made it to the LANXESS Arena yesterday, there are two more playoffs spots up for grabs today, sandwiched in the middle of a load of elimination matches. It kicks off with Group B's lower bracket matches, one featuring Virtus.pro and Falcons and the other a rematch from the play-in between Liquid and FURIA."
G2 recover from map one defeat to smash FaZe,https://www.hltv.org/news/39494/g2-recover-from-map-one-defeat-to-smash-faze,"A G2 risk to ban Inferno and leave Mirage in the pool paid off in a 13-6 decider.  The new G2 has continued its strong form by toppling FaZe 2-1 and securing a spot in Group C's final, putting them one series from Fall Final. That was despite dropping Ancient 13-9, G2's pick and the map Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač and company had a six-map winning streak on. By the time we moved to Nuke, however, G2's individuals had warmed up and the result was utter domination. It was a statement series for the under-pressure Nemanja ""⁠huNter-⁠"" Kovač, who ended top of the board with a 1.33 rating. He now has a 1.26 rating for the event, his best average since the Copenhagen RMR and far above his 1.04 CS2 average. ""Since CS2 I'm really playing a lot, that's not an issue,""  huNter- said post-match. ""When you make some changes, you want to show them that you're the player that everyone remembers and be a good example to the other players. As long as we are winning I don't care about my own performance."" Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa was the key man on Nuke, despite having four negative ratings in a row on the map for G2 and M80 as the Ramp anchor and Lobby lurker beforehand. The Guetamalan took over proceedings after a quad-kill on the MP9 in a confidence-filled display as he continues to prove both his talent and his versatility. He ended the half 17-3, and shone as the sides switched too with a sensational Deagle double-entry into Ramp — the second fully blind, and requiring an inch-perfect 90 degree snap. Map three was Mirage, G2's permaban under Rasmus ""⁠HooXi⁠"" Nielsen, and eyebrows were raised on the desk after G2 chose Mirage over their usual pick of Inferno. ""We are practicing Mirage a lot and we are comfortable there,"" NiKo had said pre-game. ""We haven't played it much as well, so it's good to have Mirage officials under our belt."" If it was intended as practice in a non-elimination match at a fairly low-stakes event, Mirage could not have gone better for G2 as they sat FaZe down by rushing to a 9-0 lead with eight rounds in a row that denied a bomb plant, and 13-6 win. It does not mean, however, that G2 are turning away from Inferno, according to NiKo: ""Inferno has been our best map, one of our best ever since I joined G2. Snax kind of has to get used to it, it's stupid not to play it when we're already really good at it."" FaZe now drop to the lower bracket against one of Cloud9 or Ninjas in Pyjamas as they look to combat their slide down the rankings. Only David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský put up any significant resistance on Nuke and Mirage, and after a poor Esports World Cup by their standards the FaZe team have a fight on their hands to return to the level required by their lofty standards. A rematch against G2 is still possible, in a match that will decide which Group C team qualifies for Fall Final early."
NIP send Cloud9 packing from BLAST Groups,https://www.hltv.org/news/39495/nip-send-cloud9-packing-from-blast-groups,"The majority-Swedish side had to grind out the series after a rough first map.  Ninjas in Pyjamas continue their journey at BLAST Premier Fall Groups thanks to a 2-1 victory over Cloud9, recovering from a spanking on Mirage (4-13) by taking Ancient (13-11) and Anubis (13-11). A match against FaZe now awaits Ninjas in Pyjamas, whilst Cloud9 are relegated to the Fall Showdown. Ninjas in Pyjamas's latest roster has steadily built up a head of steam since it was completed by the signing of Isak ""⁠isak⁠"" Fahlén in May, grabbing a second-place finish at YaLLa Compass off the back of their powerful young AWPer Artem ""⁠r1nkle⁠"" Moroz to end last season. They stumbled at the start of this season, losing to Passion UA online before being comfortably dispatched by G2 here at BLAST. It seemed to go from bad to worse on the first map of Mirage today: Cloud9 utterly decimated them, but they showed impressive fortitude to recover and grind out Ancient and Anubis to secure the series. r1nkle showed his worth on Ancient, Fredrik ""⁠REZ⁠"" Sterner put in a stellar performance on Anubis, and Ninjas in Pyjamas seemed a little more polished as a squad across the final two maps. Cloud9. meanwhile, will lament the manner in which they dropped this series, having bagged seven rounds in a row on Ancient before missing the chance to go to overtime, then dropping a 5v3 advantage with overtime once again on the line on Anubis. Cloud9's stars weren't quite productive enough on the final two maps, the team stumbled in the vital moments and made a few too many mistakes in mid-round scenarios. Considering the impressive level they showed in their match against FaZe, where they could easily have taken the series, the majority-Russian squad will regret the manner of their elimination."
Liquid move past NAVI at BLAST Groups,https://www.hltv.org/news/39496/liquid-move-past-navi-at-blast-groups,"It's the first loss since the player break for Aleksib's troops.  Liquid are through to Group D's final at the BLAST Premier Fall Groups with a 2-1 victory over Natus Vincere, extended their winning start with the new roster and inflicting the first loss of the season on the Esports World Cup winners. Fresh off a 2-0 victory against Virtus.pro in their debut, Liquid drew first blood in the series with a hard-fought win on Anubis. NAVI responded in style with a dominant victory on Inferno but were unable to complete the reverse sweep after letting a 7-0 lead slip on Inferno. Liquid are now one victory away from the BLAST Fall Final and riding a huge wave of confidence. Still, Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic was quick to remind that the job is not done. ""I feel confident, but BLAST Groups tend to be a curse for us,"" said the Canadian, who posted a 1.31 series rating. ""I think the last two we went up 2-0 and we ended up not qualifying. I hope we don't make the same mistake again."" Valeriy ""⁠b1t⁠"" Vakhovskiy apart, NAVI didn't show the same intensity they had displayed since the break, and players like Justinas ""⁠jL⁠"" Lekavicius and Ihor ""⁠w0nderful⁠"" Zhdanov were not able to make an imprint on the game. ""A shameful game from us, that's it,"" the Lithuanian wrote on X. The series kicked off on Anubis, Liquid's map pick. Natus Vincere had won one only one of their previous three games on the map, but they gave a strong account of themselves on the offense. b1t continued his good form, racking up 15 frags as NAVI picked up an 8-4 lead - a scoreline that could have been more lopsided had Mareks ""⁠YEKINDAR⁠"" Gaļinskis not pulled off a sneaky clutch in the ninth round. The complexion of the game changed after half-time as Liquid found another gear. They took the game to their opponents as they went on a dominant 8-1 record, and then held off a late comeback attempt from NAVI to lock down the map. Natus Vincere weren't shaken up by that loss and came out on Mirage looking for revenge. They dictated the pace from the early exchanges and racked up ten rounds on the offense, led by b1t, who posted a stunning 17-3 score and a 2.34 rating. The second half was a mere formality as NAVI quickly picked up three rounds, sending the series to Inferno. NAVI carried their momentum into the decider map and raced out to a commanding 7-0 lead on the T side. Liquid then finally hit their stride and enjoyed a spell of dominance, bringing the deficit down to just two rounds before the side switch. NAVI's players looked slow and uninspired, and they were unable to react as Liquid grabbed the lead after a strong start to their CT side. Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak then showed nerves of steel with back-to-back clutches, putting Liquid fully in control, and Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken's troops were able to put the series to bed on a last-gasp force-buy just when overtime seemed inevitable."
Talon confirm re-entry into Counter-Strike with AZR-led team,https://www.hltv.org/news/39499/talon-confirm-re-entry-into-counter-strike-with-azr-led-team,"AZR returns with a new team featuring an Oceanic majority and a European AWPer.  Hong Kongese organization TALON has officially confirmed its long-rumored re-entry into Counter-Strike with a team captained by former Renegades and 100 Thieves in-game leader Aaron ""⁠AZR⁠"" Ward. The Australian veteran, who last played an official match on record a year and a half ago with Sprout, has returned to link up with former Ninjas in Pyjamas coach Daniel ""⁠djL⁠"" Narancic and form an Oceanic-majority squad with a European AWPer, as reported by HLTV in late June. Former Rooster up-and-comer Corey ""⁠nettik⁠"" Browne and ex Bad News Kangaroos teammates Jared ""⁠hazr⁠"" O'Bree and Christian ""⁠ADDICT⁠"" Pendleton form the rifling trio. They're joined by Polish AWPer Miłosz ""⁠mhL⁠"" Knasiak, who last turned out for 9INE earlier this year in a brief stint on loan from Falcons, where he had been benched since November. The new team will make its debut in HellCase Cup 10, where they will compete in Group D and match up against TSM in the opening game, on Sunday at 14:30 . TALON's CEO, Sean Zhang, shed more light on the move in a video announcement. In it, he revealed the team will be playing from Europe for the majority of the time, in the organization's new facility, so that they can train against the best teams in the world on a consistent basis. Zhang tempered short-term expectations for the new squad but stressed the organization's goal is to develop the Asia-Pacific region in the long term to become among the best in the world. ""We are hoping that we are able to qualify [for the Shanghai Major] as a short-term goal, but the real objective from now till the end of the year is to get as many tournaments and as many reps in,"" Zhang said. ""For the long term, we want to develop Asian-Pacific-based CS. We've been inspired by teams like MongolZ, and we really feel like the footprint that Talon has can provide a unique opportunity for Asian CS to be given the right opportunities to become the best in the world."" The Talon chief also teased the organization's plans to help the regional grassroots scene with tournaments and academies in the future. TALON have the following roster: Aaron ""⁠AZR⁠"" Ward Corey ""⁠nettik⁠"" Browne Jared ""⁠hazr⁠"" O'Bree Christian ""⁠ADDICT⁠"" Pendleton Miłosz ""⁠mhL⁠"" Knasiak Daniel ""⁠djL⁠"" Narancic (coach)"
Live updates from BLAST Fall Groups day 4,https://www.hltv.org/news/39493/live-updates-from-blast-fall-groups-day-4," After two hard-fought maps, BIG were comfortable on the decider of Ancient to seal the series. Jon ""⁠JDC⁠"" de Castro was an absolute beast on Ancient, Florian ""⁠syrsoN⁠"" Rische was impactful on the AWP throughout the series, but it must be said Virtus.pro struggled badly on the final map. Virtus.pro head home as a result of this result and will have to fight through the Showdown, whilst BIG have earned a consolidation final matchup with Natus Vincere. BIG 11-7  Virtus.pro BIG have been the better side on this map. A varied T side has had Virtus.pro scrambling, and BIG's individuals have done very well at taking control of their respective areas of the map and finding openings in the slower rounds. BIG 8-4  Virtus.pro Some stellar work by Jon ""⁠JDC⁠"" de Castro and Karim ""⁠Krimbo⁠"" Moussa, who have 15 and 11 frags apiece, has earned BIG a strong lead at halftime. BIG were so good fighting for Mid and Lane control, and Virtus.pro couldn't really find an answer. It might have been an even bigger lead had BIG not gotten so antsy in the face of a B execute towards the end of the half: BIG 4-3  Virtus.pro Welp, just when BIG's economy was broken and it seemed Virtus.pro would build up a buffer... BIG 3-3  Virtus.pro A messy game thus far. Flanks on flanks, gaps all over the place, and more people have been shot in the back or side of the head than in straight up duels. Even stevens at this point, but BIG's money is in a delicate spot. BIG 2-0  Virtus.pro Such a nightmare for BIG. They had done so much good work to come back into the map, their trading on T side absolutely on point, only to squander it to a half-buy and a saved AWP. If not for their utterly woeful CT side, BIG might have been able to win this series in two. Instead we go to a decider. BIG 5-11  Virtus.pro BIG 4-8  Virtus.pro A very un-syrsoN round from Florian ""⁠syrsoN⁠"" Rische has helped BIG scrape a couple more rounds onto the scoreboard, making the second half far more doable for the Germans. All in all it was a poor CT half, but they've done just enough to perhaps make the map competitive. BIG 2-7  Virtus.pro BIG 2-5  Virtus.pro BIG's CT side has been ugly since guns came up. They have been repeatedly caught out by Denis ""⁠electroNic⁠"" Sharipov simply walking out of Palace, their defense has been too static and rotations too slow, and they've gambled away from B multiple times and been exposed for it. BIG 13-11  Virtus.pro BIG got proactive towards the end of their CT half, a little braver in taking control and making picks, and it bore fruit. It required some missed shots, Dzhami ""⁠Jame⁠"" Ali missed a key one on Karim ""⁠Krimbo⁠"" Moussa's Long House flank, but the fine margins decide maps as tight as this. BIG take their pick, Mirage up next. BIG 9-9  Virtus.pro Dust2 is a T-sided map I guess. BIG have looked a little disjointed on their CT side, finding it difficult to reorganize their defense in the mid-rounds. Virtus.pro meanwhile have been much improved, but perhaps it's more to do with the switch of sides than anything else. BIG 8-4  Virtus.pro It took some wild and whacky antics for Virtus.pro to stop BIG's run of rounds, but either way the Germans have posted a dominant half. BIG 5-2  Virtus.pro Rigon ""⁠rigoN⁠"" Gashi's blushes aside, BIG are dominating this half of Counter-Strike thus far. Virtus.pro are experiencing difficulties holding both sites, but they've lost too many opening kills at Long in particular. BIG 2-0  Virtus.pro An incredibly ugly clutch, but they all count. Liquid move on to the Group D final after a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Natus Vincere. Just when it seemed that NAVI were going to force overtime, Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken's troops put the game to bed on a Hail Mary force buy. Impressive recovery from Liquid, who came back from 0-7 down to win the map and send NAVI to the consolidation final. Natus Vincere 11-12  Liquid Natus Vincere 8-8  Liquid NAVI tie up the game and get back on the scoreboard after a rough period. Can they build on this and halt Liquid's momentum? Natus Vincere 7-3  Liquid All of a sudden, it's three rounds in a row for Liquid, who are taking the game to their opponents and finding success in early exchanges. How many more rounds will they be able to pick up before the half is over? Natus Vincere 7-0  Liquid Seven rounds into the game, Liquid still haven't found a way to keep NAVI at bay. Torbjørn ""⁠mithR⁠"" Nyborg has already called his second timeout. Can they find a way back into the game? Natus Vincere respond to their Anubis loss with a demolition job on Mirage. Liquid were never really in the game, and they must shake off this ugly loss as the series heads into the decider, Inferno. Natus Vincere 10-2  Liquid The first half of Mirage ends with Natus Vincere on double-digit territory. Once again, it's Valeriy ""⁠b1t⁠"" Vakhovskiy leading the charge: He already has 17 frags to his name (eight more than anyone else on his team), and he sports a 130 ADR. It looks like this game is a foregone conclusion. Natus Vincere 5-0  Liquid Liquid capitalize on their map pick as they run out 13-11 winners on Anubis. It was looking dire after the first half, but they turned it around with a spectacular T-side performance. Natus Vincere were made to pay the practice for a lackluster defense, with Valeriy ""⁠b1t⁠"" Vakhovskiy looking like the only player who was up to the challenge. Natus Vincere 8-9  Liquid It has been a flawless half from Liquid on the T side, with Mareks ""⁠YEKINDAR⁠"" Gaļinskis jumping to the top of the scoreboard with some impactful rounds. All of a sudden, Natus Vincere are on the back foot. Natus Vincere 8-4  Liquid A very solid T display coming out of NAVI, and the scoreline could have been even more one-sided if Mareks ""⁠YEKINDAR⁠"" Gaļinskis hadn't won that sneaky 1v2 clutch. Valeriy ""⁠b1t⁠"" Vakhovskiy ended the half with a 15-7 score, five multi-kills and a 102 ADR. Natus Vincere 5-2  Liquid Liquid's inability to string rounds together is really costing them in this game. Keith ""⁠NAF⁠"" Markovic and Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken have a combined 15 frags, but the rest of the team has five kills between them... A troubling sign as we reach the midway point of the half. After picking Ancient yesterday against Virtus.pro, Liquid now went for Anubis, one of NAVI's worst maps. Aleksi ""⁠Aleksib⁠"" Virolainen's troops responded with a Mirage pick, then leaving Inferno as the decider. Although they have only played the map once in the last 3 months, NAVI hammered G2 on it 13-6 at the Esports World Cup. Ninjas in Pyjamas had to fight hard across the last two maps, but the squeaked over the line 13-11 on both to secure the series. The majority-Swedish side seemed to have a better understanding of Anubis, putting up a strong CT side thanks to proactivity in the right moments. They almost squandered things with some silly rounds on their offense, but a 3v5 win sealed the deal at the death. Cloud9 11-11  Ninjas in Pyjamas That might prove very costly for Ninjas in Pyjamas, they fail to throw utility or trade against an MP9 and lose the bomb in no-mans land. Cloud9 9-7  Ninjas in Pyjamas Such a vital round for Ninjas in Pyjamas as it has broken Cloud9's economy. Cloud9 9-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas Ninjas in Pyjamas seemed to be getting the better of a hectic round, only for Nikita ""⁠HeavyGod⁠"" Martynenko to come up trumps. Kirill ""⁠Boombl4⁠"" Mikhailov seemed to enjoy that, and he had some words for Ninjas in Pyjamas afterwards. Cloud9 8-6  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 4-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Neck and neck so far in this half, but Ninjas in Pyjamas will be the happier of the two sides as they are on the unfavoured CT side. Cloud9 look a little lost for ideas if their initial plan hits a roadblock, whilst Ninjas in Pyjamas have done a nice job of disrupting the offense. Cloud9 11-13  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 won seven rounds in a row after a fast A rush to bring it from 4-12 to 11-12. The call from spawn was to hit A fast again, but this time around Artem ""⁠r1nkle⁠"" Moroz came alive with three kills on the defense to drag Ninjas in Pyjamas through the finish line and force the Anubis decider. Cloud9 5-12  Ninjas in Pyjamas Nikita ""⁠HeavyGod⁠"" Martynenko got an amazing spray transfer to open up Cloud9's first round win on the attack, although it will take a minor miracle for the Russians to come back from a 5-12 deficit. Cloud9 4-8  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 took an early lead from 0-2 to 3-2 with guns in play, but once Alejandro ""⁠alex⁠"" Masanet and his men hit their stride on the attack they won six on the trop to take an 8-4 lead at the half with views of extending the series to a third map. Cloud9 0-1  Ninjas in Pyjamas Cloud9 13-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Five rounds on the CT side turned the 8-4 scoreline at the half into a 13-4 victory. Artem ""⁠r1nkle⁠"" Moroz shined with the AWP, but otherwise Ninjas in Pyjamas were no match for Cloud9 on Mirage. Up next will be NIP's Ancient pick. Cloud9 8-4  Ninjas in Pyjamas Ninjas in Pyjamas got their bearing late in the first half and were gunning for a two-round deficit as Artem ""⁠r1nkle⁠"" Moroz got an ace, but it was too late as he had no time to defuse after the feat. Cloud9 2-2  Ninjas in Pyjamas On Ancient: ""We were a bit sleepy. We don't like these early games. We had really bad post-plants at the start of the half, they won clutches and we didn't communicate properly."" On his own form: ""Since CS2 I'm really playing a lot, that's not an issue. Of course, when you make some changes, you want to show to them as well that you're the player that everyone remembers and be a good example to the other players. That's what I tried to do, but as long as we are winning I don't care about my own performance."" Welp, that was underwhelming for a game of the day. The new G2 go from strength to strength. It's a statement series for Nemanja ""⁠huNter-⁠"" Kovač who is still under pressure to recover his CS:GO form. FaZe 2-9  G2 Even 9-0 up, you don't want to give FaZe a sniff. And Janusz ""⁠Snax⁠"" Pogorzelski may have done just that... FaZe 0-8  G2 Even Mirage expert David ""⁠frozen⁠"" Čerňanský is 3-8. FaZe are nowhere to be found. FaZe 0-4  G2 An on-form Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa (3K in the first gun) and Nemanja ""⁠huNter-⁠"" Kovač (3 in the pistol) are a terrifying prospect as a team's third and fourth stars. FaZe are finding that out, let me tell you. On Snax and Inferno: ""Inferno has been our best map, one of our best ever since I joined G2. Snax kind of has to get used to it, it's stupid not to play it when we're already really good at it. ""It takes time. Changing IGL on a map is not an easy thing. It takes way more time than replacing a regular player. He needs to know the map, study the map, know all the rotations. We are doing fine but it's not as good as it was on HooXi. ""On the veto itself, I was not involved, but we are practicing Mirage a lot and we are comfortable there. We haven't played it much as well, so it's good to have Mirage officials under our belt."" This makes sense from Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač: If you're going to try a new map, why not do it in a low-stakes tournament with no elimination on the line? A closer game than the score suggests, but all the key moments went G2's way. It doesn't help that Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa was in absolutely stunning form throughout — in positions he has struggled in this year. Good stuff from Nemanja ""⁠huNter-⁠"" Kovač, too. FaZe 6-10  G2 The best Deagle on G2? This kid is crazy. FaZe 6-9  G2 He may not play Cave anymore but Håvard ""⁠rain⁠"" Nygaard still has a wallbang in him. FaZe on a five-round streak. FaZe 3-9  G2 Okay Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa, we won't question your Ramp play again. Our deepest apologies. Just three rounds for FaZe at the half. FaZe 1-8  G2 Nemanja ""⁠huNter-⁠"" Kovač, despite a noticeable whiff on Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen, is 12-4 with Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa as G2 put FaZe to the sword. FaZe's struggles on their home map continue. FaZe 0-4  G2 No dramas for G2 at the start of Nuke as the pistol gets converted and Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa grabs four on the MP9 in a 3v5. There's pressure on malbsMd on Nuke; it's always been his worst map and he rarely looks comfortable on Ramp on CT and Lobby on T. So far, so good. FaZe 13-9  G2 Fragging and calling from Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen, as well as G2's economy being damaged by that 5v2, is what counts at the stretch and G2's streak ends at six. FaZe 8-9  G2 Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač saves the day to deny what could have been some classic G2 nonsense. Let's see if the economy damage matters. FaZe 7-8  G2 FaZe fly into B after a double kill but do not expect to find Ilya ""⁠m0NESY⁠"" Osipov on site, and get punished appropriately. A needed triple considering it's been a quiet game from the Russian thus far. FaZe 7-6  G2 G2 adapted to FaZe's position swap and Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač is warming into the game. Ancient streak isn't over yet, even if Ilya ""⁠m0NESY⁠"" Osipov and Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa have just 10 kills between them. FaZe 7-2  G2 G2 have won six Ancients in a row but FaZe are in cruise control here. Part of that is down to Håvard ""⁠rain⁠"" Nygaard, who is now the B Anchor with Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen in Cave, shutting B down time and time again. He's 12-7 so far. FaZe 4-2  G2 Plenty of Deagle prowess in the server, but FaZe have survived the early force wars and have a two round lead. FaZe 1-1  G2 We wondered if Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen would try and surprise in the veto but it's G2 who do so instead. Inferno is G2's most picked map, and FaZe even lost 13-7 to Cloud9 on it yesterday, but they ban it in favor of their old permaban Mirage. Perhaps they were scared off by FaZe's 10-1 record on Inferno before that Cloud9 game, or threw Inferno-hater Janusz ""⁠Snax⁠"" Pogorzelski a bone. Let's see how it goes. On the Cloud9 game:""It feels good to finally win a close game, there's been a lot of times recently where we haven't like we used to."" What made the difference: ""We've been working very hard, with extra emphasis on playing together as a unit instead of as separate players. When bad shit happens you get better as a team."" On G2: ""It's the same story as with Cloud9, they'll play very differently to the old G2. It's very important for our confidence to win."" Rigon ""⁠rigoN⁠"" Gashi had a debut to forget against Natus Vincere, with 12 frags, 53 ADR, and a 0.56 rating. His BIG side will once again be the underdogs as they face Virtus.pro in the last game of the day. Liquid's opponents, Natus Vincere, absolutely smashed BIG in their opener. There was a steel to Justinas ""⁠jL⁠"" Lekavicius and company as they seek to ward off the post-trophy hangover that hurt them after their Major victory. It helped, too, that Mihai ""⁠iM⁠"" Ivan was in BLAST.tv Paris Major form with a 1.71 rating. [A replay including the final kill can be found here.] Russel ""⁠Twistzz⁠"" Van Dulken's stint as Liquid captain got off to a flyer, with a 2-0 win over Virtus.pro. There were promising signs from the new boys as Justin ""⁠jks⁠"" Savage earned 80 ADR on his first match since October 2023, and Roland ""⁠ultimate⁠"" Tomkowiak came alive with several key multi-frags in overtime on Ancient. It's time for yet another FaZe-G2 bout. Nikola ""⁠NiKo⁠"" Kovač's side have now won four maps in a row against Finn ""⁠karrigan⁠"" Andersen's stumbling superteam, but are yet to play them with Mario ""⁠malbsMd⁠"" Samayoa and Janusz ""⁠Snax⁠"" Pogorzelski. We should keep an eye on the veto: The new G2 have been able to ban both Vertigo and old permaban Mirage in series after series (playing Mirage just once, and Vertigo zero). Will karrigan deliver a curveball? Dessert is served first with a mouthwatering FaZe-G2 clash, and BIG-Virtus.pro get the primetime slot. Makes sense."
BIG send Virtus.pro to Fall Showdown,https://www.hltv.org/news/39497/big-send-virtuspro-to-fall-showdown,"The German squad played a fantastic decider after two hard-fought maps.  BIG march onwards in the BLAST Premier Fall Groups by virtue of a 2-1 win over Virtus.pro, taking Dust2 (13-11) and Ancient (13-7) either side of a loss on Mirage (10-13). This result eliminates Virtus.pro, whilst BIG progress to a consolidation final matchup with world No. 1 Natus Vincere. Virtus.pro have struggled to hit the heights their roster should be capable of on paper, and with the additions of Denis ""⁠electroNic⁠"" Sharipov and later head coach Andrey ""⁠Xoma⁠"" Mironenko, they have also been undergoing a shift of playstyle. Here at BLAST, it seemed that Virtus.pro have some way to go to get themselves in top shape. After an 0-2 loss to Liquid, the Russian side came into this matchup as heavy favorites, considering how poor BIG had been in their opening game, but floundered. Not only did Virtus.pro scrape their pick of Mirage before being outclassed on Ancient, but their individuals struggled to produce enough firepower across the series. BIG, meanwhile, showed a monumental improvement on their performance against Natus Vincere in their opening game. A proactive CT side clinched them Dust2, and they recovered well from a woeful defensive half on Mirage to make that map close as well. On Ancient, the German side were a force to be reckoned with, in no small part thanks to Jon ""⁠JDC⁠"" de Castro. The rifler was a wrecking ball on CT, side taking Mid control and holding down A, and helped crack open bombsites on multiple occasions on the T side as well. Rigon ""⁠rigoN⁠"" Gashi continued to struggle much as he had in BIG's opener, which will be the point of concern for the German squad. rigoN has admitted in interviews on broadcast that he has to learn to adapt to his new roles, and on the evidence of this series, he still has a way to go."
NAVI Javelins go international after two changes,https://www.hltv.org/news/39500/navi-javelins-go-international-after-two-changes,"Liina and LETi have made way for ASTRA and D7 in the women's team's first move away from an all-Polish roster.  Natus Vincere have announced two changes to their women's Counter-Strike roster ahead of the start of ESL Impact League Season 6. The team has parted ways with one of its founding members from early 2022, Karolina ""⁠Liina⁠"" Kasprzyk, as well as Martyna ""⁠LETi⁠"" Owsik, who joined the squad in March 2023. Their replacements are Mayline-Joy ""⁠ASTRA⁠"" Champliaud and Marta ""⁠D7⁠"" Asensio, two mainstays on the women's scene for the past two years. ASTRA was last seen playing alongside her compatriots in France fe and previously competed under Let Her Cook and NIP Impact, while D7 last played for GUILD fe and BIG EQUIPA before that. With the moves, NAVI Javelins move away from an all-Polish team for the first time since the team came together in early 2022. The changes come after a disappointing end to the previous season, which saw the Poles place 5th-6th at the ESL Impact Season 5 Finals despite coming in as one of the two main favorites alongside eventual winners Imperial fe. NAVI Javelins will look to return to contention for titles with their new additions, starting with the next season of ESL Impact league. That is set to kick off at the end of August and culminate with the LAN finals in late November. The new NAVI Javelins lineup is: Wiktoria ""⁠vicu⁠"" Janicka Hania ""⁠Hanka⁠"" Pudlis Angelika ""⁠Angelka⁠"" Kozłowska Mayline-Joy ""⁠ASTRA⁠"" Champliaud Marta ""⁠D7⁠"" Asensio Adrian ""⁠AlcesT⁠"" Chyziak (coach)"
Complexity eliminate HEROIC from Fall Groups,https://www.hltv.org/news/39501/complexity-eliminate-heroic-from-fall-groups,"The North American squad will face Spirit for a spot in the Fall Final.  Complexity came into the BLAST Premier Fall Groups' Group A consolidation match with hunger for revenge as they had lost to HEROIC, who fielded coach Eetu ""⁠sAw⁠"" Saha during their run at the event, on the opening day. This time around the North Americans didn't drop the ball and beat the European combine, whose Abdul ""⁠degster⁠"" Gasanov was still sidelined due to visa issues, in two maps. Complexity switched it up in the veto and went for Anubis, the map which would have been the decider in the first bout between the two teams had HEROIC not won it 2-0. A strong CT side from Johnny ""⁠JT⁠"" Theodosiou and his men cleared the way for a dominant display on their pick, as they turned a 9-3 half to a 13-5 victory. Complexity had another strong start on the CT side, this time on Ancient, which they had lost in overtime in the group's opener, but HEROIC managed to bring it back even before the half. Frustration started to creep into the Complexity camp with Håkon ""⁠hallzerk⁠"" Fjærli even banging his desk when down 8-11, but the team rallied and, spearheaded by a fantastic Jonathan ""⁠EliGE⁠"" Jablonowski with 28 kills by the end of regulation, snuck through 13-11 to seal the deal without needing to go to a Nuke decider. Complexity, who looked lost in the opener and then had shaky moments when the beat a weak OG 2-1, will now have a chance to show their improvements when they face Spirit in the Group A final with a spot for the Fall Final on the line. HEROIC may look to the IEM Cologne Play-in with some anxiety after degster failed to make it to the tournament in Denmark, as the AWPer will need to have his visa issues sorted before August 7 if he is to compete at the tournament in Germany alongside his teammates."
